    description: `HiDERA | 02 December 2024 | 123 MB It?s a well-debated topic. Does your DAW have its own sound? In this music production video course, production guru Alberto Rizzo Schettino investigates this idea from an instructive angle, teaching you many techniques and methods to ensure that you?re getting the best results from your DAW throughout your workflow and the entire signal chain. The more complex a session is, the more room for human error there is. This production course is about determining what?s human error and what?s not, and you?ll walk away with solid, fact-based knowledge on the subject of ?DAW sound? and a whole new set of practical skills for maintaining consistent quality and results for every session, regardless of the DAW you use. Alberto begins by expanding on the topic of this series and defining what exactly is meant by this question and how it can be answered. He then shares with you the tools that we?ll use in evaluating this question. You?ll then learn a number of checkpoints you can use to verify that your DAW and plug-ins are operating at full potential without any human error. Alberto will discuss many important parameters that are common to all DAWs along with routing tips to make sure you?re not selling any of your tracks or sounds short in any way.  Next, you?ll explore the world of sound libraries, MIDI parameters, and other miscellaneous issues that crop up from time to time and must be dealt with properly, any of which could result in artifacts that will directly or indirectly affect your mixdowns. If you?ve ever wondered whether choice of DAW really does matter or if you?re making the best of your DAW throughout your recording/mixing process, this is the course for you! Alberto breaks down these ideas step by step in a clear, logical manner so you can follow these ideas in any DAW. See the individual video tutorial descriptions for more information on everything that?s covered in this series. Get to the bottom of this burning question and learn several useful tips along the way? Watch ?Does Your DAW Have a Sound?? now! What You Will Learn:\n- How to determine whether issues you hear in your mixdowns are human error or DAW-related.\n- Tweaking important plug-in and DAW parameters to ensure the highest quality throughout your signal flow.\n- Routing skills to guarantee proper signal destinations and avoid surprises come time for mixdown.\n- Maintenance and tweaking of MIDI tracks, sound libraries, and other plug-in issues that can result in unexpected results\n- And more!`,

    description: `MORiA | 14 August 2024 | 43.6 MB Meet your new favorite FET compressor Terrific on bass guitars, kicks, vocals, parallel processing, buses and more, the 1176 is one of the most iconic limiters of all time for good reason. With the MC77 you have access to the same unrivaled tone and lightning-fast response as the original 1176, with the added bonus of onboard sidechaining, stereo linking, and more.  A legend reborn\nHow do you take a legendary compressor like the 1176 and not only do it justice, but improve on it? This was the vision behind the MC77, created by Purple Audio in the late nineties. It all started with an exacting recreation of the ?E? revision of one of the most iconic solid-state limiting amplifiers of all time. From there, impeccable high-performance components were used to match the unit to the original, while adding modern features to its all-discrete signal path. Classic dynamics in the 21st Century\nThe MC77 employs Field Effect Transistor (FET) technology for gain reduction allowing for large amounts of limiting without introducing severe distortion. Its remarkably quick attack time, flexible release, four ratios and multi-button modes allow the MC77 to deliver everything from well mannered and transparent dynamics to full-on brick wall stopping power. ?sweetens the pot?\nThe team didn?t stop after finishing this pristine emulation from the ground up. They added TMT technology to provide many different analog units of the MC77 in one plugin. Use it to perfect your stereo field with its onboard M/S mode, monomaker and stereo width control. Get perfect gain staging without changing your levels thanks to the headroom knob, tailor the compressors response with integrated sidechain filters, and achieve instant parallel processing with the mix control. FEATURES:\n- Exacting emulation of the original Purple Audio MC77 Limiter\n- TMT ? patent-registered ?Tolerance Modeling Technology? (US Patent No. 10,725,727)\n- Fully endorsed by Purple Audio\n- Ultra Fast Attack Times from 20 to 800 microseconds\n- Variable Release Times from 50 milliseconds to 1.1 second\n- Authentic ALL BUTTON mode\n- Patented TMT technology for multiple units in one plugin\n- M/S Processing\n- Mono-Maker and Stereo Width control\n- Parallel Mix\n- Headroom control   FiXED iNSTALLER`,

    description: `P2P | 06 June 2014 | 520 MB Complex Analog Oscillators with 12-bit Crunch into Curtis Filters?. In the mid 80's AKAI released the infamous S900 which was to be one of the first of a new generation of highly affordable professional samplers. The S900 and it?s bigger brother, the S950, became big sellers and completely changed the playing field amongst their competitors with their five digit offerings. The S900 was a 12-bit machine with a tiny 750K memory and a floppy drive for sample storage. At the time it was a revelation but it?s now really very basic by today?s standards. However?. Like so many early samplers such as the E-mu Emulator II, the SCI Prophet 2000 and the Ensoniq Mirage, the S900 has sonic character in bucket loads and still has a following to this day. One feature of the S900 that was often overlooked was a curious 13 pin connector on the rear panel marked ?VOICE OUT??  AKAI had released a small number of polyphonic analog synthesizers during the same era as the S900. These included the AX73 keyboard and the VX90 rack mount. They have often been overlooked over the years possibly due to their rather control-free front panels and menu driven user interfaces. This is a perhaps a little unkind as these instruments feature genuine Curtis VCOs and filters unlike many offerings of the time such as the Juno-106 which was a DCO synth. To this effect they drift out tune with temperature like the best of them! Thank god for the auto-tune button!?\nThe infamous 13 pin connector permitted the sampler to be used as a complex oscillator source driving the filter stages and VCAs modulated by the envelope generators. In short, you get to mix 12-bit digital crunch with the warmth of analog filters! The Sampling Process?\nThe instruments in the S-VX Hybrid Library were constructed using several vintage analog sound sources acting as complex sampled oscillators feeding the VX90 synth. This formed the basis of an unusual albeit somewhat clunky hybrid synth?. Sound sources were mostly Minimoog model D but also included 1938 Novachord, 1967 Philicorda GM751, 1978 ARP Omni-2 string section, Roland JUNO-106 polysynth and 3 tube waveshaped 1960's tube oscillators beating in parallel. 32 ten second long raw oscillator sources were captured in 12-bits using a recently refurbished S900 fitted with a new backlight and a (superb!) Lotharek HxC virtual floppy drive. The results were stored on SD card as part of a bank of 79 virtual disks. The resulting interim sample set acted as oscillator sources for the VX90. Several patches were programmed on the VX90 to filter the oscillators transposed over five octaves from the S900 and the results from the VX90, including it?s gorgeous analog chorus, was multi-sampled direct from the output in 24-bit stereo. 376 samples were captured in this manner for the library. The result??\nComplex warm analog oscillator sources transposed over 5 octaves with a touch of 12-bit crunch shaped with classic Curtis VCFs and VCAs! System Requirements\n The S-VX Hybrid Library requires Kontakt version 4.2.4 or higher`,

    description: `PDF | ENGLiSH:61.9 MB | GERMAN:25.0 MB (English and German Edition) TECHNO MASTERCLASS ? How To Create Hard & Hypnotic Techno. Whether melodic, hard or hypnotic ? Techno regularly reinvents itself, but the essence remains: ?The beat has to go on and on?. That?s why we?ve got the answer to all your questions about production here! From choosing the right kick to clever synth layering to the latest trends in sound design ? we?ll show you step by step how to build rumbles, create hissing hats and find catchy melodies. In other words, Techno with hit potential!  Hands-on Workshop: Sounds like Brutalismus 3000\nThe hard, dirty sound of the Berlin producer duo, which brings you back to the dance floor even after 10 hours of partying, is being celebrated by more and more people in the truest sense of the word. The rule is: it has to be a bang. We?ll take a look at how you can get the sound of Brutalismus 3000 into your own DAW in just a moment. Brutal Bass Unit for free: HALO-2 Lite by DHPlugins\nMany sound designers have cut their teeth on the brutal bass and lead sounds of Drum & Bass, Future Bass and Dubstep. With our software highlight, DHPlugins HALO-2 Lite, they become child?s play. This monster synth combines powerful synthesis with flexible samples and shines with massive Basses, screeching Leads and classic Reese sounds ? perfect for bass-heavy genres! Test: Behringer Syncussion SY-1 ? Cult drums for under 200 euros\nSyncussion SY-1 is a two-channel drum synth that drum manufacturer Pearl developed in 1979 to complement acoustic drums. As Techno music became popular in the 90s, the sounds were also used for hard bass and bone-dry percussion, which gave the Syncussion cult status and still leads to high used prices today. We have tested for you whether the inexpensive Behringer replica is an alternative to the rare original. Test: Freqport FreqTube FT1 ? Tube sound via plug-in\nThe sound of analog tubes, in particular their harmonic distortion, is probably one of the most common reasons why analog outboard equipment can still be found in many studios. On the other hand, good analog effects are also expensive and digital plug-ins are getting closer and closer in terms of sound. Freqport aims to combine the best of both worlds with FreqTube. 79 Basses & inspiring Chords: Synth Classics II for Zampler & MPCs\nSynth Classics II takes you on a journey to the golden era of hardware gear: 79 presets shine with the remarkable flair of legends like Sequential Circuit Prophet, Odyssey, ARP2600, Oberheim SEM and Novation?s all time classic Bass Station ? accompanied by bonus patches from Peak and the compact Prophet clone Toraiz AS-1.

But when it comes to shaping the pitch curve and leveling certain bands a dimension of endless possibilites opens. KickDrum was created to achieve maximum precision with an intuitive workflow, while exploring this dimension, aiming to achieve the desired sound in a short time.  KEY FEATURES:\nPhase Zero Crossing\n- The phase control enables precise adjustment of the phase zero crossing. For instance, it can be positioned at the end of the kick, to create a phase-accurate transition to the bassline. Length\n- The length of the kick can be set relatively to match the beat grid or statically in milliseconds. Free B?zier Curves\n- The B?zier curves gravity point can be freely adjusted on two axes for more precise shaping. Full Navigation\n- Use the right mouse button to zoom and pan on the Oscillogram, Decibel scale, Pitch Keyboard, or EQ, offering precise editing down to the sample. One Click WAV Export\n- Copies the current kickdrum as a .wav file to the clipboard, allowing it to be pasted anywhere needed. Synthesis integrated EQ\n- The fully featured synthesis integrated linear phase EQ applies its frequency response during the synthesis, resulting in latency-free and DSP-efficient equalizing. Rich Preset Browser\n- Create, rename, delete, tag, filter, and sort presets or manage subdirectories with the fully featured preset browser. Keysnap\n- If needed, the pitch curves points snap to the closest musical note, making in-key editing easy.  Changelog 2.0.3-2.0.4\nRelease 2.0.4:\n- bug fix: folders and filenames with non-regular characters are now displayed correctly\n- bug fix: import of samples with non-regular characters now works\n- bug fix: clicking Settings in rare circumstances could lead to a crash\n- bug fix: vertical scaling does not reset on undo/redo anymore\n- bug fix: preset storage path no longer stored in preset file (happened since 2.0)\n- bug fix: EQ spectrum could have stopped being drawn in certain cases`,

    description: `ARTiCSTORM | 01 December 2024 | 3MB Discover exciting ways to generate new patterns and manipulate your existing sequences with a Pack that demonstrates the exciting potential of Live 12?s MIDI Tools. Philip Meyer has dedicated himself to exploring ways of making MIDI sequencing as intuitive and expressive as possible. This Pack of MIDI Tools showcases some of his most versatile devices, roughly split into two categories ? generators and transformations.  Generators:\nPhase Pattern: Phase Pattern is a rhythm and melody generator for Ableton Live. Basically, you bend time and that creates a rhythm. Got it? It?s great for ?bouncing ball? rhythms like on Monolake?s Toku. If you want, you can quantize the rhythm to the MIDI Clip?s grid, and you can also modulate the pitch and velocity over the course of the rhythmic pattern. Polyrhythm: Polyrhythm is a multitrack algorithmic sequencer for generating a quick beat or melody. I really like using it with a drum rack to get a beat started. The length of each pattern can be set independently, which makes the rhythms it generates feel a lot less boring and loop-y. There are two pattern algorithms: a classic Euclidean, and Omni, which allows you to generate literally any gate pattern up to 16 steps in length with just three controls. Stages: Inspired by stage-based sequencers, this device allows the user to control the length, pitch, and division of each stage, offering a broad scope for rhythmic and melodic exploration. Retrigger: A Transformer that repeats MIDI notes, a bit like a MIDI Beat Repeat. This device is similar to by subdividing transformers (Divs, Segment, and others), but instead of evenly dividing a note, it repeats the note at some interval. The pitch or velocity can be modulated over the course of the retrigger events, and the retrigger interval can also be modulated to create bouncing ball events and other nonlinear rhythms. Slice Shuffler: Slice the clip into segments based on some grid interval, then reorder start time of the notes inside the slices. This device doesn?t transform notes, make new notes, or delete notes; it just changes the order in which the notes appear in the clip. This one is simple, intuitive, and super useful. The user selects a Slice Interval that will divide the clip into sections. The matrix UI below will update its number of columns to match the number of slices. Requires Live 12.1 and Max 4 Live!`,

A convolution reverb takes a sample from a real-world space (called an impulse response or IR) and uses this to digitally simulate the reverberation of that space. ?Only a convolution reverb can capture the ambience of a real space, or real hardware, and recreate it on a computer,? explains Ableton sound designer Christian Kleine. ?With a convolution reverb, you can easily access the reverb of many spaces, and still tweak them.? Convolution Reverb Pro allows for extended tweaking options such as EQ, damping, modulation, and more. ?The reverse function in Convolution Reverb Pro is especially nice,? says Christian. ?You can modify an original IR to something completely new, and then resave the design as a new preset.? Convolution Reverb Pro also allows for combining two IRs?one for early reflections, and one for late?for a hybrid sound that combines elements of multiple spaces.

    description: `BUBBiX | 01 December 2024 | 50 MB PLATFORM: VST2/VST3/AAX(MOD) The HG-Q plugin, a meticulously modeled version of the forthcoming HG-Q hardware EQ that?s seven years in the making. Building on the acclaimed collaboration that brought the HG-2 to life, this revolutionary EQ combines analog warmth with cutting-edge flexibility and tonal depth, bringing an entirely new dimension to EQs.  EQ with rich saturation and pristine cuts\nFeaturing six bands of fully independent boosts and cuts, HG-Q is a creative powerhouse that reshapes and enhances your sound in a totally unique way. Boosts combine gain with Black Box?s trademark analog tubes, adding rich, creamy harmonic content without muddying transients or compromising mix clarity. Cuts are performed with a pristine solid-state circuit for reduced distortion. This leads to the best of all worlds and one-of-a-kind interactions. HG-Q gives you refined control over every element of your mix. Dynamic control, ultimate creativity\nSculpt frequencies to remove unwanted elements while simultaneously enhancing key tonal characteristics with Black Box?s coveted creamy saturation. Harness analog with total control of dynamic phase interactions and the ability to adjust Q values for each band independently. This is the sound of modern analog. Every frequency, every detail ? fully under control\nUnlike conventional saturation, the HG-Q?s circuit brings out lower-level details and enhances the mix density, resulting in a fuller, more vibrant sound. The ?2X? mode further expands the EQ?s range, allowing up to 16dB boosts and cuts with intensified saturation that brings out every harmonic nuance. The result is a more cohesive, balanced, and musically engaging sound, achievable even at aggressive settings. Shape, shift, and reshape ? all within view\nHG-Q has a one-of-a-kind topology. Its bands interact with one another in a totally new way. You?ll love hearing how boosts and cuts add character to frequencies on other bands, or watching and controlling these special interactions with the built-in spectrum analyzer. A new way to EQ\nAs you start boosting, cutting, adding saturation and switching between series and parallel, you will unlock a new wildly complex set of satisfying interactions and curves. View the HG-Q is not your conventional EQ, as its strength lies in dramatically contouring and reshaping audio material to enhance your mix in a masterfully musical way. It is truly the first of its kind. Features:\n- Collaboration with Black Box Analog Design: The HG-Q plugin is meticulously modeled after the upcoming HG-Q hardware EQ, continuing the successful partnership that produced the acclaimed HG-2.\n- Revolutionary EQ: Combines analog warmth with cutting-edge flexibility and tonal depth, redefining possibilities in audio production.\n- Six-Band Structure: Features three independent bands for boost and three for cut, offering refined control over every element of a mix.\n- Simultaneous Frequency Sculpting: Allows users to remove unwanted frequencies while enhancing key tonal characteristics through dynamic phase interactions.\n- Advanced Saturation Circuit: Adds rich harmonic content without compromising transients or clarity, enhancing lower-level details for a fuller sound.\n- Tube Saturation in Boost Bands: Each boost band incorporates a tube saturation stage, adding warmth and harmonic richness to the signal.\n- Solid-State Technology for Cut Filters: The cut filters utilize solid-state technology, ensuring precise and clean frequency removal.\n- 2X Mode: Expands the EQ?s range to allow up to 16dB boosts and cuts, intensifying saturation for deeper harmonic nuances.\n- Musical Phase Interactions: Adjust the Q of cuts to be narrower and switch between series and parallel modes to create musical phase interactions that enhance mix elements.\n- Stereo, M/S, Dual Mono and Mono processing\n- Plugin-Only Features:\n- Expanded view with multilayer knobs extracted to dedicated controls\n- Aggressive saturation mode to unleash harmonics\n- High-resolution EQ-curve to visualize dependencies and interaction between bands\n- Auto-Listen\n- Scalable UI Version 1.0.1 (Nov 28, 2024)\n- Fixed graphical performance issues\n- Fixed stuck boost gain callout after switching to expanded mode\n- Fixed that the band active buttons do not turn off when the plugin is bypassed.\n- Fixed static highlighted pixels in all eq curves\n- Fixed crash when switching channel count in mono gui (reaper)`,

The metering capabilities of the DPMP plug-in let you control and monitor audio signals exactly the way you want: almost every aspect of the peak, RMS and crest factor meters can be customized. It proposes five different scales by default, including Bob Katz?s popular K-System scales (K-12, K-14, K-20), and you can create your own. Large colored statistics displays following your own scales are included for an overview of a track, while histograms give you a precise measurement of the dynamic range of the track. The graphs show the evolution of the audio envelopes over time, and the mid-side switch lets you verify mono compatibility problems and check the ?stereoness? of your audio sources very easily. Whether you are working with mono, stereo or surround tracks, this plug-in will fit into your workflow.  All envelopes (peak, RMS, crest factor?) can be reused for additional monitoring or side chaining purposes: combined together, reversed, modified and recorded as automation curves or sent as MIDI CC messages, they can control other effects in real time. Main Features:\n- Multichannel peak, RMS & crest factor meter.\n- -True dynamic range measurement with levels histograms.\n- Instant, average and maximum audio levels.\n- Modular user interface to fit into your workflow, with multiple screen sizes.\n- Total control over the metering characteristics, including attack/release shape.\n- Bob Katz?s K-System scales support (K-12 / K-14 / K-20 and custom)\n- Mono, stereo, mid-side or surround analysis.\n- Record measurements (peak, RMS, crest factor, clip etc.) as automation curves.\n- Control in real time any MIDI-compatible plug-in or external MIDI device with the generated envelopes thanks to the plugin?s MIDI CC output. See the Tutorials section for more examples.\n- Manage the shape of the output envelope: record reversed envelope, change amount of signal, and offset the generated envelope. This lets you use the plug-in for side chain ducking, compression and much more.\n- Easy ?stereoness? and phase cancelation measurement.`,

    description: `FANTASTiC | 02 October 2024 | 94 MB ..:: AU, VSTi, VST3, AAX, x64, x86 ::.. RYM2612 is a software FM synthesizer in VST, Audio Unit, AAX and Rack Extension formats. It?s an emulation of the Yamaha YM2612 sound chip, best known for being the vibrant voice of the Sega Genesis/Megadrive videogame console. More than a simple sound-alike, the emulation is cycle-accurate to the original chip, that allows reproducing every unique possibility of the synth. On top of this, the amp circuitry of the console has been reproduced too, in order to obtain the same grain you?d get if you plugged the real hardware into your DAW.  Key Features:\n-Cycle-accurate emulation of the YM2612 FM soundchip\n-Genuinely reproduces the unique and characteristic sound of its hardware counterpart (digital saturation, huge feedback amount, natural distortion, ?)\n-Audio input for adding 8-bit PCM sweetness to any signal\n-Low CPU usage\n-Switchable output filtering and ladder effect\n-A couple of limitations from the soundchip have been taken away : up to 16 voices of polyphony, dedicated PCM channel (you can of course stick to 6 simultaneous voices if you want to experience the real thing)\n-100+ various, sorted, evocative patches to start with The 16-bit legacy\nNot many people were aware of this, but unlike other videogame consoles, the Sega Genesis/Megadrive had a complete FM synth onboard. The Yamaha YM2612 provided enough features to produce complex, evolving tones, as well as crazy sound effects and PCM samples playback. This is your chance to get your hands on this altered beast, combined with the rich control and modulation possibilities offered by your modern DAW. Insert extra patches\nMeet RYMCast, the perfect companion app for RYM2612. It?s a Genesis music files player that has the special ability to let you mute/solo each channel of your favorite soundtracks and to drag & drop the sounds directly to an RYM2612 instance. Also, RYMCast is free and runs on Windows, macOS and GNU Linux.`,

Using Bitwig?s powerful modulators and Polygrid functions, we create seemingly complex patches and pleasing synth sound designs. Once we throw them into huge reverbs and delays, the outcome is mind-blowing! Although these tips showcase Bitwig?s capabilities, if you have access to LFOs, many of the ideas generated here can be replicated across different DAWs. The possibilities are endless, and as Nate shows, it?s just a case of experimenting and having fun! Check it out!`,

P42 Climax is an innovative multifaceted powerstrip for tone shaping/coloration, saturation and conjures more of the idea of working with hardware. P42 Climax begins with the heartbeat of a hardware line amp, and ends on every single track because it has the cpu coverage to do so (more than 300 instances in a single session). Sculpt your perfect sound whether processing a single instrument, grouped tracks, the 2-bus or even when mastering. The sound is simply? unbelievable! Don?t underestimate the few parameters in P42 Climax. It is chameleon like, able to assimilate many different coloring hardware devices, but never intended to copy any single one! P42 Climax works magic on drum bus, snare, and of course the bass guitar. Inserting P42 on the 2-bus track, immediately opens up your mix and exposes hidden gems in your mix. With its Mid/Side processing and detailed metering (peak, RMS and LUFS) and Auto. Gain Compensation workflow, P42 fits nicely into your mastering signal chain.  Don?t get scared by the price tag- a comparable hardware unit for a single channel costs around $1,700. Check the Audio examples below as we compare P42 Climax plugin tone shaping against the Neve 1080, Studer A812 Tape recorder, WolfBox DI and other hardware devices. Features:\n- Organic hardware-like feel & behavior.\n- Pulsar Modular signature Shelving EQ (Low & High).\n- Signature LPF and HPF\n- Tube-like odd harmonics saturation slider.\n- Super low cpu tax and zero sample latency!\n- Works with Mono, Dual Mono or Stereo signal.\n- All parameters are exposed to your DAW for automation.\n- macOS: AU, AAX and VST3 formats.\n- Windows: VST3 and AAX formats.\n- Linux LV2 format coming soon! Changelog:\nVersion 5.7.0 Oct. 11, 2024\n- Fixed clicking sound and latency reporting when OS is ON for Studio One DAW.`,

    description: `SYNTHiC4TE | 11 May 2017 | 3.26 GB The deepest koto, bass koto and shamisen library ever released, featuring world-class performer Masayo Ishigure! 2 mic positions, extensive dynamics and RRs, FX patches and extensive traditional and contemporary articulations. We created Koto Nation out of a desire to see traditional Japanese instruments receive a deep, thorough sampling treatment, much like our acclaimed North Indian sample library Sitar Nation. While there are a handful of libraries which include samples of the koto and shamisen, they feature only the most basic articulations and few (if any) velocities or round robins. To our knowledge, the bass koto has never been sampled at all! Given the popularity of the shakuhachi and taiko in many Western film soundtracks, we wanted to allow film composers, hobbyist producers, ethnomusicologists, anime fans and everyone in between access to these classic instruments and complete the repertoire of traditional Japanese sounds available.   This library includes a massive number of samples spanning a wide variety of both traditional and extended playing techniques all recorded by koto legend Masayo Ishigure (Memoirs of a Geisha). This includes close and stereo room mic positions! A total of 25 main patches spread among the three instruments cover all crucial playing techniques, such as sustained picks with a plectrum, pizzicato, octaves, glissandi of multiple types and speeds, vibrato, tremolo, mordents (pitch bends), and mutes, as well as extended techniques such as atonal glissandi, finger scrapes, string hits and hard plucks. Multiple dynamic and round robin layers were recorded for each articulation, as well as variations in speed or tonality where appropriate; for example, the koto tremolo can be played at two main speeds (with fine speed control), mordents can be set to whole-tone or half-tone, glissandi can be played slow, fast and in ascending, descending or mixed order, and so on. This incredible depth of sampling allows for unparalleled realism, allowing the instruments to stand alone in a solo context as well as in a larger composition.\nInstruments Koto\nThe national instrument of Japan, and one of the oldest stringed instruments in the world! The koto has 13 strings with an equal number of movable bridges allowing the player to adjust tuning, something that is often called for in pieces. It is traditionally played using three finger picks used to pluck the strings, but a variety of other techniques have developed as well such as finger tapping, harmonics, pizzicato, etc. Bass Koto\nDeveloped in the early 20th century, the bass koto is a much larger version of the standard koto which adds 4 additional strings and allows for much lower pitches to be played. Its deep, warm sound and large range has made it popular in some forms of Japanese traditional music as well as contemporary music. Shamisen\nLike the koto, this three-stringed developed centuries ago and became an integral part of Japanese music, perhaps most associated with its role in traditional theater where it is still used. It is typically played with a large plectrum, and can be played solo, used to accompany singing or other instruments. Many playing styles have evolved over the years ? we recorded a shamisen constructed and performed in the classical jiuta style, as opposed to the tsugaru style typically used in rock or pop music. Special FX\nAlso included in the Koto Nation library is a set of 9 ?FX? patches, which apply online and offline processing to the core audio to take it in new, musically interesting directions. These sounds range from granular pad textures to warm sustains, drones, airy resonances, percussive hits, distorted synths and eerie ambiance Nearly 4,000 detailed samples\n- Close and room mic positions\n- Koto, bass koto, and shamisen\n- Traditional and extended techniques\n- Bonus FX patches\n- Bends and mordents\n- Beautiful menus of glissandos Features:\n- Fresh new UI reworked in 2017\n- Easy mic mixing, per-artic ADSR\n- Flexible microtuning\n- One-touch filters, CC-learnable\n- TACT for 100% custom artic control\n- Built-in FX rack Requirements:\nRequires KONTAKT 5.5 (full version) or higher.`,

    description: `TEAM HCiSO | 15 January 2025 | 58.26 MB GateMate is an innovative approach to a noise gate. A pair of plugins (Pre and Post) makes it possible to clean up the sound like never before. The Noise Gate That Gets It Right Noise gates are supposed to solve a simple problem, not create new ones or feel like a compromise. We wanted better. We spent months perfecting a noise gate that doesn?t choke your tone, responds naturally to your playing, and handles all the dirt and dynamics. The result? A gate that just works. No gimmicks?just performance you can rely on. GateMate?s main role is to provide a complete noise cancellation solution. To do this, you will find two GateMate Pre and GateMate Post modules. One is placed upstream of your favorite amp and baffle simulator, and the second is placed after. GateMate Pre cleans the incoming DI signal, and collects the data necessary for the proper functioning of GateMate Post, which refines the latest finishes.  On the GateMate Pre interface, you have a control of the amount of noise reduction applied. On the GateMate Post interface, attack and release controls (which you can automate) as well as a threshold control are available. A channel selector is also on both interfaces, you will have to set it to a common channel. ?

    description: `P2P | 28-06-2015 | 534 MB NI Razor is a totally different beast, this amazing additive synthesizer allows you to create complex and especially unique refreshing sounds using just sine waves. First let?s dive in to the main controls and concepts so that we have a clear understanding of what this synth can do. Additive synthesis is very different from all the other forms of sound design since it uses only sine waves to build more complex waves.  Razor uses this ?building with sine waves? technique to build its basic saw waves but also a lot of other cool sounds. All the effects in Razor are based on this as well, they will not really change the existing sound, they really change the harmonics to create a new sound. This results in a very clean and precise sound that stand out because of clarity and focus. It takes a little while getting used to though, thats why I explain the whole interface first in this video. The first thing to take notice of is that you can change pretty much all modules inside Razor by clicking on their name.This opens a window with a lot of different sound sources and effects to choose from, all with different control panels and different sounds.The routing is very simple from left to right with all the modulation sources at the bottom, this makes it very easy to visualise what it happens, especially with the help of main analyser window.This window exactly shows what we?ve talked about, you can see the harmonics changing, shifting higher, getting louder, or softer when filtered.Keep an eye on this display while designing your first sounds to get an idea of what a sound is doing, and how it works, this will make your learning curve a lot steeper and you?ll get a bigger understanding of additive synthesis pretty quikly!`,

    description: `TEAM HCiSO | 15 January 2025 | 248.02 MB .: The Best Sample Browser :. Sononym is a sample browser that offers a fresh perspective on how sounds can be explored and organized. The software is available for Windows, Linux and Mac OS X.  Features:\nAudio Analysis\nAsk Sononym to analyze a folder, and all available information ? tempo, pitch, amount of noise, harmonic content, etc. ? is collected from your files and stored in a database. This ensures blazing fast access as you search, filter and sort your way through vast amounts of samples. Similarity Search\nSimilarity search enables you to find similar-sounding samples in your sample collection. Basically, pick any sound as input and ?see where it takes you? ? finding variations has never been this easy. For more control, you can determine how much individual aspects (e.g. similarity across pitch or timbre) should matter. Smart Categorization\nWhile analyzing your samples, the software uses machine learning to categorize the content. The default set of categories in Sononym are broadly based around electronic music production and describe distinctive groups of sounds such as ?snare drums? or ?synth pads?. In addition, all sounds are classified as either looped or non-looped (one-shot) sounds. Bookmarking & Exporting\nSononym combines bookmarking and exporting into a single workflow. You can freely organize, tag and rename your bookmarked files in projects, which are automatically exported to a folder of your choice. We believe that picking out sounds of interest and making them available elsewhere should be an effortless thing to do.

Perfect on their own or as reinforcement for electronic drums, Drum Booth also offers a selection of unique experimental recordings not heard in standard acoustic libraries.  Hi-end acoustics\nThe sounds in Drum Booth were recorded with a very dry sound, to allow for most flexible post processing options. This Pack includes 64-pad multisampled kits as well as 16-pad one-shot kits. Choose a multisampled kit if you need the expression of a real drummer, or load a single shot kit to create hard-hitting, straight-forward grooves that are equally at home in both electronic genres, as well as those with more traditional instrumentation. The acoustic effect sounds go far beyond what you might expect from an acoustic drum kit, adding another dimension that lives somewhere between acoustic and electronic and giving you a wealth of sound design possibilities. Pack contents:\n- 20 Kits with 16 Pads using one-shot samples\n- 3 Kits with 32 Pads using multisampled drum hits\n- 3 Kits with 64 Pads using multisampled drum hits, laid out for finger drumming\n- 2 Finger Snare Kits using 64 one-shot samples; these were recorded with the snares off and played by finger, each sample representing a different region on the skin\n- 103 multisampled Drum Hits you can use to create your own drum kits Contents:\n131 Presets, 1 Live Sets, 373 Live Clips\nSize Installation size: 2.45 GB\nDownload size: 1106.7 MB\nRequirements:\nLive 12 Suite (version 12.0 or higher)`,

    description: `MaGeSY | 11 September 2015 | AKAi:326MB | KONTAKT: 418MB This is a custom crafted version of the choir library, heavily modified to be more useful in a modern sampler like Kontakt. It?s an old library (very hard to find now, too) but extremely useful because it has consonants sampled individually (such as T, P, K, and Tzz) as well as uncommon singable consonants (such as Mmmm, Rrrr, and Zzzz). It is best used to ?punch up? your favorite choir by overlaying syllables and consonants to help enunciate whatever your choir is already singing. The flexibility of this library to create any word you want is pretty good, just add your own reverb to blend it in with your choir library of choice.  Up to now, people have always simply done some kind of automatic conversion from Akai CD to Kontakt, which technically works, but the library simply isn?t very user friendly because you end up with 100?s of .nki files with parts of an instrument spread among several .nki files. Even worse it?s usually hard to figure out which instrument to use because some of them are left or right channel only, or mono converted, or a short looped version to save memory, or any of a dozen other things that are simply a waste of time in a modern sampler. This particular version was painstakingly created (by hand!) over two days in order to eliminate all that confusion, and was carefully planned out to be the most user friendly version available; About 95% of what you will need when using this library has been placed into a single .nki that has been setup with keyswitches. Going even further, a custom script was created to display the keyswitch layout while you?re using the instrument so that you never get lost or have trouble finding what you need. Additionally, everything has been compressed to .ncw so the footprint is smaller, and a .nicnt + wallpaper have been created so that you can simply add the library to Kontakt without the hassle of manually creating your own library file. If you are in the habit of creating your own library files it is recommended to make sure that the SNPID number doesn?t conflict with something else you?ve already added into your library.`,

    description: `MORiA | 10 March 2024 | 31.9 MB The original KLEIN & HUMMEL UE-100? EQs are extremely rare and expensive. But Rafa Sardina ? who has 12 Grammy wins and 35 nominations ? owns 10 of them! What is so special about this weird and wonderful device? For some time, hardware equalizers had to each be developed with a specific purpose in mind, requiring engineers to combine different EQ types in one signal chain in order to achieve the frequency response they needed on any given source. They would have to accept the necessary evil of the resulting phase and intermodulation distortion when treating these sounds. When released in 1961, the Klein & Hummel UE-100 Universal Equalizer changed all that. This all-tube minimum phase EQ used six discrete filter modules to create a collection of band-pass filters that could create dynamic curves for any application from source mixing to vocal tracking to mastering. While some earlier UE-100s were used to transparently filter out junk low and high frequencies when printing to tape and vinyl, it quickly became commonplace to take advantage of the unique pushbutton frequency selection; this provided an easy way to not only recall settings, but also alter them on the fly while recording a performance. The UE-100 became known for its musically warm curves and precise response, offering a myriad of possibilities for treating frequencies by boosting and/or cutting across the spectrum to shape sounds ?like a Pultec on steroids.?  That tube-powered universal sound and innovative behavior from K&H is now available to you in plugin form. The Lindell TE-100 is an exacting emulation of all the sweet and savory frequency treatment offered by the original hardware EQ. Right down to the pushbuttons on the interface and the all-tube filter bypass, the TE-100 re-creates this piece of German audio history with immaculate realism. Only now, a stereo pair won?t cost you $10,000. Hone in on your sound with low and high pass filters at each end of the TE-100, then boost at one of four critical frequencies with rounded or high-Q shelf bands to add body and presence. Create dual parametric band-pass filters in the TE-100?s mid section to quickly bring out the true character of your sound. The pushbutton frequency selectors offer a unique way to shape your frequency response by focusing on each corner frequency of a filter and moving those frequencies closer or further apart while letting your ears guide your mix decision. The TE-100 plugin also adds a few useful extra features that help improve workflow in the digital environment: Maintain full control across a variety of mix situations by taking advantage of level calibration, internal oversampling adjustment, and an analog mode that adds additional tone coloration and noise floor taken from the original unit. Dial in precise gain adjustments in 0.5 dB steps, contrasting the 2 dB to 3 dB resolution available through the knobs of the original hardware. With the Lindell TE-100, the legacy of the original Universal Equalizer can be brought to your DAW in a convenient digital form that stays true to the hardware.`,

This particular combination ? largely the result of the unique tonality for this narrow space in time of this speaker model?s production ? results in a sound that is full yet tight in the lows, authoritative and forward in the mids, and smooth on top, with just enough bite to cut through a dense modern mix when paired with the right mic/mix selection. The lack of overly whomping low end and harsh high end makes this file set incredibly versatile, and useful for a multitude of styles and applications.  Feature Set:\n- 10 single mics (7B ? 57 ? 58 ? 87 ? 121 ? 160 ? 414 ? 421 ? 441 ? 906)\n- 10 core mixes\n- 80 (r)Evolution mixes\n- 90 mic pair mix permutations\n- Captured through major production/mastering grade signal chain File Format:\n- Wave Audio (.wav) Wave audio format IR?s (.wav) are compatible with convolution reverb type loaders in recording software and outboard hardware units.

Provided in 192 khz, 96 khz and 44.1 khz. 63 presets. Library size is 1.49 GB. 10 distortion kernels. This box is the stuff of legend for mastering guys. UAD made a plugin version that some users feel lacks a little bit of the vibe of the real box. Well today you can get a little bit of that magic back by purchasing this library. Get the transformer magic by using it with the UAD plugin . These are subtle but consider sandwiching the plugin between two instances if it is too subtle for you. Here are Bypassed presets, through the engine but not the transformers, then the transformers without GR and finally with some GR.  ( WHAT IS A MOJO SET? A common complaint facing Nebula users is the GUI and the workflow which may require a number of steps that an algorithmic plugin simply avoids. For example, to get more than one band of equalisation in most cases you need multiple instances of the plugin and the bands don?t always interact like the hardware would. But the sound is stellar. You also have a limited level of dynamic levels with eqs in a lot of cases. A common complaint of accurate algorithmic plugin emulations is that they possess the correct curves of an eq but lack the warmth, depth and 3 D qualities that the hardware does. In other words the mojo. They have fully interacting bands and often an accurate GUI that people are familiar with. The Mojo series are samplings to give you the tone of the hardware that allows for a hybrid approach . Simply put, with Eqs and compressors you can use your favourite emulation plugin to control the action and curves and just use my presets to add the much needed clarity, 3D quality, dynamics, warmth etc. It is my attempt to allow you to use your favourite plugin but to add the mojo that plugins lack. So the Mojo series does not compress or eq but give you the tone of the compressor or eq hence the need for the plugin. Mind you any plugin will do but the emulations are more accurate at getting you closer to the hardware. ) This is a cutting edge library guaranteed to make your mixes sound less digital. You will be amazed at how someone had placed a sock over your digital files. Sampled at the highest sampling rate available to date in Nebula Libraries and delivered at that rate. Native 192 khz sampling and also 96 khz available. Designed to work best at 96 khz. This means you need to be patient as the libraries load and resample internally. Don?t worry, the quality will speak for itself. You will be amazed at the improved transient response.  Please note that these require Nebula Pro to enjoy.`,

Choose from a sheer endless amount of CLICKS, SNAPS, MOVEMENTS, COMPLEX SOUND SEQUENCES, RATTLING, ROLLING, SLIDING, SPRINGS, TURNS & SWEETENERS. Different sizes, multiple variations and a huge palette of different machines and mechanism sounds give you full flexibility to enter a new world of outstanding sound effects. SONIC CHARACTERISTICS\nWe recorded the mechanical sound effects with only small reverberation rooms to give you as much flexibility as possible. The dry and very close sounds can easily be integrated into other reverberation rooms and afterwards you can add as much reverb to your sounds as you need. WHAT WE RECORDED\nThe recordings for MECHANICALS were very interesting. We searched quite some time to find a collector of really rare, old, strange and charming machines (i.a. a successor of the famous Enigma) that surprised us with some very unique sounds. Everywhere where mechanics took place we pointed our microphones towards it and captured the sound. We recorded really small and wispy mechanics as well as huge machines and old, almost forgotten slot machines from the 1900s like chocolate- and gaming machines, type writers, check writers and printing machines.

Keemun is an innovative musical instrument that recreates the sound of a professionally-recorded bass DI, allowing keyboard players to craft realistic and expressive bass lines all on their own. Clean, high quality Bass DI tones ready for your favorite effects Because so many of the most legendary bass lines in history have been recorded with nothing but a good DI input, Keemun gives impressively massive results right out of the box, with just a touch of EQ and other processing. But Keemun is at its best when it is REAMPED with your own favorite bass rigs and effects?whether physical or virtual?for even more unique and inspiring tones.  Better than sampled bass\nOrdinary sampled basses have never quite sounded realistic because the harmonic resonances of a real bass are different for each quick combination of notes. This is why WEDGE FORCE built their proprietary ?Synthetic Force Engine II?. It combines studio sampled waveforms of the world?s most iconic custom-made basses and recording chains with real-time synthesized sounds. Capture a bass player?s full range of expression\nUnlike other bass synths and samplers, Keemun synthesizes each note in real time, using algorithms that are carefully designed to preserve the original waveform?s timbre during pitch bending, sliding, muting, slapping, plucking, picking, pulling and pinching of bass harmonics. Fast enough for live performance, easy on the CPU\nKeemun?s sound engine has been optimized for performance up to the last CPU cycle to free up resources for the effects and synths may be running alongside it. Using 64bit double precision for internal calculations, the latency of instruments is close to zero?less than 1 millisecond?so it feels and responds just like a real instrument should.`,

Reshape Any Audio Signal with Unique Echo & Pitch Modulation\n- ILLUSION is a unique delay plugin that was heavily inspired by vintage hardware delay pedals.\n- To be more specific, this plugin is a detailed emulation of a bucket brigade delay (BBD).\n- The delay / pitch shifting capabilities of ILLUSION can transform any sound thousands of different ways.\n- Whether you?re using it on a melody, one shot, vocal, percussion, drums, etc?\n- We designed this plugin to instantly transform any audio signal you throw at it.\n- Make sure you listen to the ?before and after? demos below to get a better understanding of what it can do. What makes Illusion special?\n- This plugin harnesses the magic of analog gear, infusing your sound with the richness and warmth that genuine BBD (Bucket Brigade Device) technology is admired for.\n- ILLUSION pushes the boundaries, stacking not one, not two, but FOUR of these iconic BBD chips, allowing you to re-imagine the sonic DNA of any sound with pinpoint accuracy.\n- And then, there?s the unpredictable pitch-shifting sequencer. It?s not just about delay; it?s about sculpting your sound in ways previously unimagined.\n- With ILLUSION, you?re free to explore, to innovate, to create something truly unique. How does Illusion work exactly?\n- ILLUSION seamlessly blends the realms of delay and pitch shifting, with precise control over the outcome.\n- The Delay feature controls the timing at which the delay is triggered with multiple parameters including Glide, Ping Pong, Feedback & BPM Sync.\n- The Filter parameter controls the strength of your audio signal through the cutoff frequency of a low-pass filter.\n- The Modulation parameter controls the pitch of the delayed signal by modulating the Clock rate.\n- The adjustable Loop Length parameter controls the amount of time it takes before the affected audio loop.`,

    description: `P2P | 10? October 2011 | 285.10 MB For this library of Inspiring Guitar Loops, asked guitar player R?mi Saboul to create various guitar parts, including rythmic chord progressions, vamps, signature voicings and guitar solo phrases. He also proposes many sound textures such as wah wah and reverse effect and it sounds great! As usual with loops, feel free to pitch shift, filter or apply any kind of transformations to the loops to create your own sounds. Some of these loops have been inspired by Nu Jazz Grooves Vol 1 so if you also need some drum and bass parts, check this library out!`,

    description: `TCD | 20 August 2024 | 116 MB AMPKNOB BDH BUNDLE Legends of high-gain. Get access to three incarnations of an era-defining high-gain tube guitar amplifier. Work fast and get the album-ready guitar sound you?re after without endless tweaking or second-guessing. The Ampknob BDH plugins have been expertly sound-designed by renowned metal producer Jens Bogren and offer an authentic studio-worthy tone.  AMPKNOB BDH 5169\nThe one that started it all. Based on the original ?block letter? amp head from 1992. Its aggressive and punchy high-gain tone quickly made it a winner among heavy metal and metalcore bands from the mid-90s and onwards.\nTo this day, it?s the amp to beat for other high-gain guitar amp manufacturers. AMPKNOB BDH 66o6+\nDevilishly heavy ?Sixty-Six-Oh-Six? is based on a hot-rodded and modified ?plus? version, which was originally a later generation of the amp from around 2000.\nThe modifications ordered by Jens make this amp breathe, spit and bite in a way that is the opposite of stale modern high-gain amps.\nIt?s truly one of a kind ? a sound you will not find anywhere else! AMPKNOB BDH III\nThe modern take. With a full and rich sound, the dense distortion works exceptionally well for modern riffs, as well as creamy leads.\nThe original unit is from Jens Bogren?s personal amp collection and a part of many albums created at his Fascination Street Studios. Included:\n- BDH 66o6 Plus v1.2.118\n- BDH 5169 v1.2.134\n- BDH III v1.2.199 Required: Microsoft Visual C++ 2015-2022 Redistributable\n- v14.30.30704.0 or greater, x64.`,

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 13 October 2024 | 27.4MB Control M?ag Audio?s flagship EQ and its AIR BAND? like never before Overview M?ag EQ4 M is a 6-band dual channel mastering EQ that counts Chris Lord-Alge (Greenday, Madonna, U2) and Tony Visconti (David Bowie, T. Rex, Esperanza Spalding) among its many fans. Now Brainworx, the masters of analog modeling, have finally transformed this renowned hardware into the M?ag EQ MS plugin.  M?ag EQ4 M ?in the box?\nBrainworx worked closely with the M?ag family on the M?ag EQ4 MS, to deliver the most accurate emulation of M?ag hardware ever. This unique design provides unparalleled transparency and top end presence while maintaining the true natural sound behind the signal or mix. Get even more flexibility with two optional center frequencies and bell-characteristics in lower bands. Harness the AIR BAND? \nNo M?ag EQ would be complete without an exact recreation of M?ag?s trademark AIR BAND?. This is the ?secret sauce? of production giants David Reitzas, Dylan Dresdow, and Dave Pensado. The AIR BAND? brings smooth air frequencies to your top end without harshness. It works great on drums and instruments, but it really shines through on vocals. You can hear its sparkle on tracks from Celine Dion, Madonna, Justin Timberlake, and countless others. The definitive M?ag EQ emulation \nNothing sounds more like the M?ag hardware, and nothing gives you more control over M?ag?s legendary AIR BAND?. Use it across your mix, on individual tracks, busses and stems, with a new level of control only possible in the digital realm. Brainworx has also added adjustable bands, monomaker, soft clipper and patented Brainworx TMT. Beyond the hardware\nBrainworx has also expanded the controls of the original hardware, achieving accurate stereo and m/s processing without compromising its exceptional sound quality. Push undesirable frequencies out of the limelight and bring hidden treasures to the fore, without compromising the range in the center of your acoustic field. M?ag EQ4 MS gives you more control over the stereo field than any previous M?ag plugin or hardware. Features:\n- Exacting model of M?ag EQ4 M hardware and its trademark AIR BAND?\n- Stereo and m/s processing\n- High and low pass filters in each channel\n- Expanded bandwidth and center frequencies for all bell filters\n- Mono-Maker and Stereo Width\n- Variable Total Harmonic Distortion\n- Soft clipper\n- I/O, correlation and balance-metering\n- Parameter Link\n- Scalable UI\n- Additional center frequencies for all bell filters\n- Q-factor for all bell filters\n- Brainworx?s TMT inside: Tolerance Modeling Technology (US Patent No. 10,725,727) simulates 20 channel-to-channel variances in electronic components for the most realistic analog sound in digital recreation of analog characteristics`,

    description: `ZODiACK/MaGeSY | 16 September 2016 | FULL: 11.60 GB VST2/VST3/AU/AAX x32/x64 & LEGACY PRESETS One thing to notice is that Wusik Station V8 is actually a NEW product. I didn’t just took V7 code and made it cross-platform. No, I started from zero, reusing Wusik 8000 code which is cross-platform and uses modern coding. This presented some problems, but also introduced a lot of new great features that V7 did not have, but also removed some features that V7 had and now I need to work on.  What has changed on V8?\n– Cross platform: Windows and MAC (possibly Linux too, later this year).\nThis alone may not seem much, but it is, most of the work will be recoding the project so it can use modern cross-platform code instead of the current code.\n– Multi Line Graphical Envelopes. (*)\n– New Filter Types, including a custom user filter script type. (*)\n– “Unlimited” number of parallel filters per layer.\n– “Unlimited” number of chained effects per layer insert and per master sends (2 in total).\n– “Unlimited” number of Mod Envelopes and LFOs.\n– Better Wavesequencing style (*)\n– Audio Looper layer, which samples any incoming audio signal and let you play like an instrument. (*)\n – Multi Layer with the option to select the type of layer: Sample PlayerWave SequencerDrawable OSCSuper OSC3 OSC (with Noise generator)Audio LooperGroove Sequencer (not included yet) – Per Layer ARP and also a Master ARP.\n– 16 Steps Polyphonic Sequencer per layer, to be used as a Modulation Source on the Mod Matrix.\n– Per Layer Key Switching and Sticky Keys options.\n– Per Layer Modulation Matrix.\n– New Interface and Skin.\n (*) borrowed from Wusik 4000 & 8000 code Jul 15 2015 – V8.0.2:\n– The Tree File Browser now has a new option that let you link manually any older Wusik Station / Wusik EVE Data folders and also up to 3 extra user folders (which you can rename them in any way you want to show on the tree view). Click on the top area to open up the options menu and click on “Manage Extra Folders”. The linked folders are also used by the sample player to check for preset sounds.\n– WS Legacy Filter: fixed a crash when the filter was in Bypass mode and some parameter was tweaked.\n– Sample Player: fixed a mute problem when playing samples in dual-mode.\n– More optimizations done.\n– Several small fixes done.Jul 06 2015 – V8.0.0: \n– Initial Release (coded from the ground-up)Sounds (with legacy presets) included in the full version:\n– Analog Night 1-18\n– Artvera NewAge Collection WS V8 2-18\n– Drum Collection 1 3-18\n– Drumillenium 4-18\n– Ethermos Nocturnal 5-18\n– Extra Sounds: Dreams and Nightmares Seeds 1\n– Extra Sounds: HQ Grand Piano\n– Extra Sounds: HQ Grand Piano Wusik8000 Presets\n– Extra Sounds: Mega Bass and Pads Collection\n– Extra Sounds: Wusik EVE Sounds\n– Famous Keys 6-18\n– HQ Guitar Sets 7-18\n– HQ Piano Sets 8-18\n– HQ Synthetica Complete 1 9-18\n– HQ Synthetica Complete 2 10-1\n– Hybrid World 11-18\n– Orchestral Lite 12-18\n– Physical Set 13-18\n– Retro DS 14-18\n– SNDS AdventureKid Waveforms\n– SNDS Legacy Presets\n– SNDS Ridan Sounds\n– The ElectroBank One 15-18\n– The Sound Bank 16-18\n– The SoundBank Plus 17-18\n– WS Dnekm Presets\n– Wusik Sound Magazine 18-18   DiSCONTiNUED: https://mage.si/SCeW3\n Wusik Station 8 v8.0.2 and Legacy Presets WiN MAC-ZODiACK\n♪ Download ♪`,

    description: `CRD | 12 January 2025 | x86+x64: 41MB Music enthusiasts are constantly looking for specialized software solutions that can help them come up with innovative sounds and create great tunes. Those who often work with MIDI files can rely on SynthFont to manage their files and to render audio tracks, as soon as a SoundFont is loaded.  Powerful playback utility for MIDI files\nThe user interface might seem a little overwhelming to novices, since it comes packed with a flurry of functions and features, so you might need to take some time to discover each of them so as to get the most out of your tracks. You can start by opening an existing MIDI or arrangement file, such as MID, MIDI, RMI, KAR, SFARR or S2ARR. If you prefer to create a new project from scratch, you first need to specify the initial number of tempo tracks you want to add, then choose the MIDI program you prefer. Handy editing functions for your MIDI projects\nOnce the file you are interested in is loaded within SynthFont, you can start editing its notes, while keeping in mind that you can only process the ones from the active track – however, you can simply double-click a note to make its track active. From this point on, you gain access to a wide range of features that are best understood if you experiment with each of them, especially if you are not familiar with the terms. For example, you can modify the number of beats and the tick fractions, as well as the standard length, the vertical and horizontal zoom or the melodic scale configuration. Reliable and feature-packed MIDI processors\nAll in all, SynthFont comes in handy to all those who want to finetune their MIDI tracks, then load a corresponding SoundFont and listen to the output. It supports numerous types of source files, so it can be adapted to many uses.`,

    description: `HiDERA | 11 January 2025 | 385 MB Join studio guru instructor Eli Krantzberg for an in-depth video course on using intelligent plugins to mix drums quickly and effectively! In this mix course, you’ll learn a plethora of techniques for handling all kinds of drum mixing duties, from correcting phase issues and reducing bleed to using adaptive EQ and compression, smart limiting, and more. The skills learned in this drum mixing course will pay big dividends as well because they can be adapted to other instruments as well! Eli begins by introducing the various plugins that will be used throughout the series, providing before and after examples for you to familiarize yourself with. Then it’s on to the first topic, alignment, and you’ll see how Auto Align 2 (from Sound Radix) can automatically correct phasing issues on a multi-tracked drum kit.  Next, you’ll learn how two drum-specific plugins—Drum Lever (Sound Radix) and Oxford Drum Gate (Sonnox)—can quickly and easily reduce bleed from various drum mics, followed by a look at spectral shaping with Sculptor (iZotope), which can optimize the resonance and balance of each drum. Throughout the rest of the course, you’ll learn several other handy techniques, such as adaptive EQ with Surfer EQ 2 from Sound Radix (which can intelligently target specific important frequencies for attenuation or boost), reverb and adaptive unmasking using the unmasking feature in iZotope’s Aurora (to dynamically carve out space for the drums to increase their presence and punch), adaptive compression with Powair from Sound Radix (which automatically adjusts the input level to the compressor in real time for ultra-smooth and transparent compression), and more! If you’ve struggled in the past with getting your drums to cut through the mix the way you want, this is the course for you. After watching, you’ll be prepared to incorporate these ideas into your next mix and significantly enhance your drum sounds! See the individual drum mixing video tutorial descriptions for more information on everything that’s covered in the course and ideas on how you can use these concepts in your own mixes. Mix smarter, not harder … Watch “Mixing Drums with Intelligent Plugins Explained®” now! What You Will Learn:\n– Correcting phase alignment issues quickly with Auto Align 2.\n– Emphasizing the natural resonance of each drum with Surfer EQ 2 (adaptive EQ).\n– Carve out space for the drums with the unmasking feature in Aurora.\n– Using parallel processing with Surfer EQ 2 and Powair (adaptive compression) to add saturation to the sustain element of the drums only.\n– And more!`,

Whether you want to be a music producer assistant or just need to prepare your own DAW session for mixing, this DAW video course is for you. This course covers a wide range of topics, including track cleaning and management, effective bus practices, gain staging, channel strip settings, and more. The steps covered in this DAW course will help you make the most of your mixing session and avoid getting mired in unnecessary clutter and other time-wasting issues. These DAW videos are designed for anyone who works with DAW sessions. Alberto begins by discussing what mix prep is, why you should do it, and how it can help streamline your workflow and produce better results in a shorter time. Then he gets down to business, starting with importing any necessary audio and making sure it conforms to your project. This is followed by the topic of routing and bussing, which is essential to good organization, among other aspects.  Next, you’ll dive into gain staging—first drums/bass and then guitars/keys/vocals—which is crucial in making sure you have plenty of headroom throughout the mixing process. Alberto then tackles the topic of lead vocal prep, including splitting the different parts so that you’re ready to process each section according to its specific needs. Throughout the rest of the course, Alberto covers the remaining topics, such as inter-phrase gain staging the lead vocal (making sure the vocal level sits nicely from word to word), mix bus prep (assembling the effects chain), channel strip prep (setting up necessary plug-ins, defaults, etc.), printing tracks (revisions or rough mixes), and more. By taking a bit of time at the beginning to complete these steps, you or your mix engineer will be sure to have a productive, enjoyable mixing session that will save time in the long run and will very likely produce a better mix.

    description: `HiDERA | 05 October 2024 | 319MB .: with Virtual Instruments :. If you’re a fan of modern metal but you don’t play a stringed instrument or have access to the gear you need, this course is for you! Production guru Gary Hiebner shows you how to create incredible modern metal tracks using nothing but virtual instruments. A feat that was unheard of a decade ago, it’s now possible to realistically emulate all these sounds without ever strapping on a guitar or bass. You’ll learn invaluable tips on maximizing realism with MIDI tracks, most of which will be applicable in any genre, as well as arranging and mixing concepts along the way. These videos are for metal fans who want to create modern-sounding tracks using the tools they have available. Gary begins by providing a concise summary of the topics covered in the series, then delving into the various VIs he will utilize for drums, bass, guitars, and synths. Then it’s down to business, starting with the drums, where you’ll learn valuable information on selecting the appropriate kit, programming realistic parts, and editing velocities for increased authenticity. A demonstration follows, showing you how to route the individual drums to separate outputs for separate processing in the DAW.  Next, it’s time for the bass—specifically a low-range bass to match our low-tuned guitars. Gary will talk about various methods of making sure the part you program sounds realistic (using keyswitches, editing velocities, and more) and discuss tonal considerations like blending clean and saturated sounds to craft the final bass tone. There’s plenty more as well, including drum fills (to help transition between sections), guitar tones (selecting amp/cab models, double-tracking, etc.), single notes and chords (using legato, creating chords from single notes), additional guitar articulations (usings techniques like slides, tremolo picking, pitch bends, string noise, etc.), changing tunings (changing “virtual” guitar tunings in the middle of the song), clean-tone riffs (ambient tones to contrast the heavy guitars), guitar lead lines (vibrato, octaves, etc.), mixing the guitars (using buses, EQ, compression, saturation, sidechain compression, etc.), arranging the song (combining the various parts created into a full song by consolidate the different keys and tempos used throughout), and more! There’s no need to put it off any longer. You can now create phenomenal-sounding modern metal tracks entirely in the box, and this metal production course will walk you step-by-step through the process! See the individual video tutorial descriptions for more information on everything that’s covered in this course and ideas on how you can use these techniques in your own music.

    description: `HiDERA | 05 October 2024 | 216 MB Join mixing wizard Thomas Cochran for a fun, exciting tutorial series on using clipping in various creative ways. You’ll be amazed at how this technique can elevate your mixes in numerous ways, especially if you’ve always avoided clipping (as instructed when you started recording) and never experimented with the idea. This course covers everything from adding grit and saturation to an instrument to preventing the need for over-limiting on your master bus, among other useful tips. By the end of the course, you’ll be ready to begin using these techniques right away on your very next production. These mixing videos are for those who are new to the topic of intentional audio clipping. After welcoming you to the course, Thomas begins by showing how clipping can be used on electronic drums to add saturation and increase energy. This can really help bring a stale drum beat to life. Next, you’ll learn how to apply clipping to acoustic drums, primarily for taming peaks rather than saturation.  Bass guitar applications come next, and you’ll discover how clipping on a bass can add fullness and control the levels nicely. Thomas then demonstrates the technique on various buses to increase a mix’s fullness and/or help push the overall level. You’ll finish off with a look at using clipping to increase loudness without having to over-limit, thereby reducing possible unwanted artifacts. You don’t want to miss this course, as these techniques can be employed in many different styles and scenarios. It’s an underused concept that can really transform the sound of a mix, and this course is the fastest and easiest way to learn how it works. Check out the descriptions of each creative clipping video tutorial for further details and discover how you can incorporate this effect into your upcoming track. You’ll be clipping along before you know it! Watch “Creative Mixing with Clipping Explained®” today!

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 05 October 2024 | 72.5MB PLATFORM: AU/VST2/VST3/AAX The APU Loudness Limiter is a real-time limiter designed to support multiple loudness types simultaneously. The limiter can be configured to use LUFS, True Peak, RMS, and/or Peak loudness types. This allows you to target multiple requirements simultaneously, such as a specific LUFS target and a specific True Peak target. Internally, the ballistics of the limiter are adjusted to accommodate the different loudness type limiter settings.  Loudness flavors\nOne of the key features of this limiter is its support for a variety of loudness types. The limiter’s detection circuitry can be configured to use either LUFS and/or traditional measurement units (RMS, Peak). You can also choose to split or link channels, which is particularly useful for multi-channel audio formats such as Dolby Atmos®. The limiter’s detection circuitry can be configured to use any of the following loudness types:\nMomentary\nMomentary is a short duration LUFS measurement (400ms), which is useful for processing the audio’s moment-by-moment dynamics. This mode is responsive but also transparent. K-weighting and channel weighting are applied to the compressor’s detection circuitry, improving perceptual accuracy. Momentary LUFS Short-Term\nShort-Term is a longer duration LUFS measurement (3 seconds), which is useful for processing the audio’s large scale dynamics. Given the longer duration, this mode is less responsive than momentary, but it can be useful for adjusting the bigger picture of the audio’s dynamics. K-weighting and channel weighting are applied as with momentary. Short-Term LUFS Integrated\nIntegrated is an infinite duration LUFS measurement. K-weighting and channel weighting are applied as with momentary, as well as both relative and absolute gating. This loudness type can be useful for continuously wrangling the audio’s integrated loudness toward a specific target. Integrated LUFS RMS\nRMS loudness types use a rolling time interval of 150ms by default, which can be adjusted. RMS is a traditional loudness measurement, which is a good first-order approximation of perceived loudness. This mode doesn’t apply K-weighting or channel weighting to the limiter’s detection circuitry, giving it a more traditional character. RMS True Peak\nTrue Peak loudness types are similar to traditional peak measurements, but they are more accurate as they take into consideration inter-sample peaks. These measurements use a time interval equal to the configured block size (1ms by default). This mode prevents clipping inter-sample peaks, which can be useful for mastering. True Peak Peak\nPeak loudness types are a standard peak circuit, operating on a time interval equal to the configured block size (1ms by default). This is another traditional limiter style measurement. Technically, this mode is even slightly more responsive than True Peak, but it is less accurate as it doesn’t take into consideration inter-sample peaks. Changelog:\nVersion 3.0.0\n– Initial limiter release (limiter)`,

Thanks to more than 3,300 authentic grooves, STUDIO DRUMMER makes it easy for anyone to produce lifelike, dynamic drum tracks. And the on-board mixer and powerful effects deliver enough usability, versatility and tweakability to meet the demands of eclectic modern producers.

Mixer presets, with precision mic levels, room sound and effects, provide fast-track settings for a wide range of sounds. A high-quality studio effects section gives you warm tape saturation, convolution reverb and three big-league effects: the SOLID G-EQ, the SOLID BUS COMP compressor and the awe-inspiring TRANSIENT MASTER.

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 07 June 2024 | 27.2 MB x64: AAX, VST3i, VST2i The oberhausen draws deep extensive experience of working with analog audio equipment to creatively craft world class mixing and mastering plugins. As the cutting-edge company’s highly-anticipated first Virtual Instrument, it effectively revisits an acclaimed analog synthesizer expander module much loved by generations of musicians for its sought-after sound. The sound itself is reliant on fully-analog, discrete circuits and a classic state-variable 2-pole filter. Some of the key features which have never been done before on this synth is a powerful unison mode, M/S Technology.  Full analog modelling\nOriginal or otherwise, the acclaimed analog synthesizer’s sound now benefits from the ultimate upgrade. Thanks to Oberhausen with full polyphony of up to 32 voices, twice the voice count of today’s priciest poly synths remaining resolutely in the analog domain, users can create sounds that are not possible using the original hardware! Unison\nThe voices can be combined to a powerful unison mode. When used with the unique TMT feature, Unison generates a rich, complex and analog sound unparalleled by any other virtual instruments. M/S Technology\nIntroducing an unheard feature to the world of synthesizers, this allows you to select which part of your sound passes through the filter section and which doesn’t. Allowing for subtle effects like solid bass foundation as well as crazy stereo processing. Effect Section\nThese are not just effects. We took some of our best products and shrunk them into an effects rack that is proudly carrying the Brainworx brand. We also asked our partners at Mäag to add their infamous AIR BAND®. The signal chain in the effects section can easily be altered by a drag & drop function. Extensive Modulation Matrix\nThe modulation matrix gives you a whole dimension of sound design possibilities. FM included\nAdding Frequency Modulation to an analog synth classic allows you to push the boundaries of creativity much further than the original synthesizers. Arpeggiator\nThe arpeggiator comes with all the functions you would expect from it – including an adjustable “swing” parameter. In-Plugin Preset Management with NKS support\nThe preset management system allows you to categorize your presets for easy retrieval. You can mark favorites and add your own comments.The bx_oberhausen comes fully loaded with over 300 presets created by the most renowned professionals.The preset management system is fully NKS compliant and nicely integrated with NKS-enabled products. FEATURES:\n– Full analog modelling with full polyphony up to 32 voices.\n– Unison: Combine your voices to a powerful unison mode. Together with the unique TMT feature, Unison generates a rich, complex and analog sound unparalleled by any other virtual instrument.\n– M/S Technology: Create subtle effects like solid bass foundation as well as crazy stereo processing with M/S Technology.\n– Modulation Matrix: The extensive Modulation Matrix gives you a whole dimension of sound design possibilities.\n– Effect section: small versions of effects products proudly carrying the brand – including the infamous Mäag AIR BAND®.\n– FM: We push the boundaries of achievable sounds by adding Frequency Modulation to an analog synth classic.\n– The arpeggiator comes with all functions you would expect from it – including an adjustable “swing” parameter.\n– In-Plugin Preset Management with NKS support.

Each sound inside the chord one-shots also comes in a variety of chords and voicings, great to create your own chord progression with. You might have heard some of the chord samples (the ones called BellThing) in the intro of “Reconnect” and some of the single notes (especially Lowboi_C.wav) in “Embark” on the Stealing Fire album :)`,

    description: `Team V.R | 10 January 2025 | 130 MB (Win64; AAX*, VST3, VSTi) The Legend HZ has been designed with great care and attention to detail, so that no opportunities were missed to create a software synth which is both highly usable and insanely versatile. It is at heart the product of the combined knowledge of a genre-defining composer and Synapse Audio’s experience emulating an industry-defining synthesizer. Building on the success of The Legend, we’ve teamed up with Hans Zimmer to mark new ground in analog modeling synthesis. Multiple features have been added to The Legend HZ that were previously unavailable with The Legend. These include an additional three oscillators (and with them an added polyphony setting), a modulation matrix, a 32-step sequencer, an MSEG for added modulation controls, and an expanded effects section. The Legend HZ even contains a fixed filter bank that was modeled after Hans Zimmer’s personal Vintage 914 Fixed Filter Bank, an exceptional and rare piece of hardware.  Moreover, 200 factory presets developed jointly by expert sound designer Kevin Schroeder and Hans Zimmer have been added. The factory soundbank gives anyone access to a wide range of cinematic-style sounds, while The Legend HZ itself provides access to some of the very tools used by them. The Legend HZ features summary\n★ Accurate circuit simulation\n★ 6 high-quality VA oscillators\n★ 8x oversampled engine\n★ Comprehensive effects section\n★ Unison, Mono, 4-,8- and 12-voice Polyphony modes\n★ Support for MPE (MIDI Polyphonic Expression)\n★ Advanced Arpeggiator/Sequencer ﻿`,

    description: `JOSENACHA | 10 January 2025 | 2.72GB DRUMLAB is the first-of-its-kind instrument combining the organic, expressive sound of acoustic drums with the power and punch of an electronic edge. The secret weapon of top professionals in a super-intuitive interface that makes mix-ready drum design fast and fun. Create thousands of new drum combinations that bear your signature stamp and kick with ultimate impact. Get into the lab and start experimenting – DRUMLAB guarantees a winning formula every time.  DRUMLAB’s fundamental sound is built on an all-new set of premium drum samples. 38 individual drums were perfectly tuned and performed by top-tier drummer, Derico Watson. All drums were recorded in three different rooms to ensure maximum sonic versatility. High-end modern and vintage gear captured every nuance of the performances on analog tape. Grammy-winning producer Kenny Barto was then brought in to polish the sounds to a professional shine. The key to DRUMLAB’s alchemy is an advanced layering technique used by top hitmakers to give drums maximum weight and punch in a mix. 80 electronic layers from a range of classic and modern drum machines were expertly matched, phase aligned, faded, and pitched with the acoustic samples. Choose your own combination of each element, then dial in the perfect blend with a convenient slider on the front panel. The finished sound is mixdown-ready and always uniquely yours. DRUMLAB’s controls and effects turn up the heat to bond pro performance with an ultra-intuitive workflow. An elegant main screen puts every essential control in one place for ultra-fast drum selection and blending. A unique effects chain features an optimized drum compressor, TRANSIENT MASTER, SOLID EQ, and SOLID BUS COMP, plus convolution reverb – all with simple controls for quick adjustments. DRUMLAB also integrates perfectly with MASCHINE for the ultimate in hybrid drum groove production. Groundbreaking drum sound without a tight, pro performance? Not with DRUMLAB. Over 900 drum patterns and fills in a wide range of genres and styles – all recorded live especially for DRUMLAB – deliver everything you need for instant pro sound. DRUMLAB gives you a visual groove display so you know exactly where drum hits line up – seeing is believing.  Find the beat that suits the track you’re working on, choose fills and variations to match, then drag and drop into your host sequencer. And if you’re a drummer, just hook up your e-drums and you’re ready to go.  Number of instruments: 1 NKI for hybrid custom drum kit consisting of:Kick (9 variations)Snare (10 variations)3 Toms (6 variations)Hi-hat (7 variations)Ride cymbal (2 variations)2 Crash cymbals (4 variations)A choice of 5 percussion sounds from 20 different instrumentsPlus a set of perfectly mapped and matched electronic layers for kick, snare, toms and hi-hat (20 variations each)108 NKIs for individual drum instrumentsTotal of sampled acoustic instruments: 58Total of electronic layering sounds: 80  Version 1.2.1 2025-01-08\n– FIXED – Velocity bug when two notes played at the exact same MIDI tick\n– ADDED – Studio Drummer mapping preset for compatibility with MIDI files from Studio Drummer and other Abbey Road Series`,

In addition to these powerful instruments, Kepler offers a variety of other specialized tools, each designed to excel in specific areas. Let’s take a closer look at these additional instruments: TRAILER HIT KIT\nThe Trailer Hit Kit is the premier choice if you aim to add powerful Hits to your score. Each color on the keyboard signifies a different Hit. Each Hit is crafted using 6 Round Robins. The Trailer Hit Kit can be used by manually playing the Hits, or you can rely on the internal sequencer. LOW PERC, HIGH PERC, FOLK PERC\nThis set of hybrid percussion is perfect for creating percussive layers with great impact. As with the Trailer Hit Kit, you can choose to program the parts manually or use the internal sequencer. In this case, remember to set the Track Delay to compensate for the 20ms delay of the arpeggiator. This set of instruments is built with 12 Round Robins and 5 dynamic levels. KEPLER BASS\nIn Kepler, you will find a powerful Bass that is perfect for adding strong bass parts to your hybrid cues. It is a very deep acoustic bass, sampled with 6 Round Robins and 5 Dynamic Levels. At the highest level, glide samples are mapped. Experiment with this instrument also through the internal sequencer to quickly create fantastic and powerful bass parts. STOMPS, BOOM & METAL HIT\nThe instruments Stomp, Boom, and Metal Hit do exactly what their names suggest. Their operation is exactly the same as previously seen for the other rhythmic instruments. Kepler also features several types of Whoosh. These instruments are always synchronized to your session. TRUE LEGATO VOCAL DRONE\nInspired by the vocal sounds of the film *Dune* and Hans Zimmer’s soundtrack, Kepler includes two True Legato Vocals. These patches are sampled in the key of F. Each note contains a different syllable, which will be connected to others through the True Legato sampling technique, allowing for a smooth transition between syllables. KEPLERIAN THROAT SING\nThis is not an instrument that uses true legato. It is a polyphonic instrument, allowing for vocal textures based on throat singing. With the modulation wheel, it is possible to alternate the voxels to create movement. KEPLER BREATH SEQ\nThis is a very simple instrument to use. Press the blue key, and it will start a rhythmic sequence based on breathy voice sounds. It’s useful for creating rhythmic vocal parts similar to those in Dune. The instrument is a combination of two modules: Arpeggiator and Builder. The Arpeggiator triggers the notes, and you can define the rhythmic structure in this module. The Builder module allows you to change the syllables for each step. CHOIR BREATH\nThe sound suite of Kepler is completed by these two instruments, which were created by sampling syllables sung by a male choir of 15 members and a female choir of 15 members. Different syllables are mapped to each note. Both instruments are mapped in exactly the same way, facilitating, for example, the creation of a Multi Instrument to combine Male-Female voices. Features:\n– 20 Multi-Sampled NKI Kontakt Instruments.\n– Over 30Gb of 24bit, 48Khz samples.\n– Core Designer with over 400 multi-sampled sound elements.\n– Texture Designer with Organic Textures, Violins Textures, Choir Textures and more.\n– Thousands of Cinematic Snapshot Presets with the Installer for the Core Designer and Texture Designer.\n– Low Percussion, High Percussion, Folk Percussion with up to 12 Round Robins and 5 Dynamic Levels.\n– Trailer Hit Kit with 6 Round Robins.\n– Multi-Sampled Bass Instrument with 6 Round Robins and 5 Dynamic Levels.\n– Whooshes, Booms, Risers and Stings.\n– Male Vocal Drone with True Legato.\n– Female Vocal Drone with True Legato.\n– Choir Breath Voxels with many different syllables.   IMPORTANT: ETHERA Gold Prometheus requires the full version of Kontakt 6.8.0! It will NOT work in the FREE Kontakt Player.`,

    description: `TCD | 04 June 2024 | 1.06GB (Win64; AAX, VST3, VSTi) Tomofon – Real Audio Synth We are pleased to introduce Tomofon, a completely new expressive audio synth. This virtual instrument introduces a new “Audio Model” format capable of containing thousands of waves extracted from ordinary audio files. These waves – and how they’re structured – lays the ground for how Tomofon generates audio, resulting in a highly flexible and instantly expressive instrument. that on one hand sounds very organic and on the other, like something out of this world. Whether you want to play around with the Audio Model Starter Pack (instruments & voices) and factory presets, or import your own audio to shape your own unique soundscapes – it is fair to say that you are in for a creative journey.  How does it work?\nTomofon converts audio files into a large set of oscillating waves, which then are mapped into pitch zones where each wave represents one layer (a bit similar to how a sampler structures different velocity zones). The main difference is that since each zone is populated with waves instead of ordinary samples, the synth engine can morph between them (both layers and zones). This makes all transitions between zones and layers continuous and seamless. This structure containing these organized wavetables is what we call an Audio Model, and give Tomofon its dynamic properties and characteristic sound. Create and share your own unique sounds\nA significant feature of this plug-in is that users can import their own audio files and create new and unique Audio Models. Ordinary audio files (preferably with monophonic content) can easily be imported and distributed into different pitch zones over the keyboard range, either automatically or manually. Doing an automatic import is basically a one-click process which instantly results in a proper playable Audio Model. A manual import gives the user full control of which waves should end up in which pitch zone. Last but not least you can easily share your own created Audio Models with others. Tomofon comes pre-loaded with a pack of 124 Audio Models based on high quality audio recordings of multiple expressions. These models includes several instrument like strings, vocals, brass, woodwind, guitars and more. Along with these models there are over 180 presets to get you going right away. From there on you can venture further and start creating Audio Models based on your own audio files and experiment on the types of sounds they can grow to be. Features:\n– Wide selection of factory models and presets\n– Integrated audio sample importer and Audio Model editor\n– Pitch and (layer) depth envelopes that can be edited by the user\n– Envelope times can separately be controlled via MIDI velocity\n– Several LFO’s (including Sample and Hold with randomness)\n– Modulation matrix (2 x MIDI CC, Velocity and Keymap)\n– Monophonic playback with separate glide times for pitch and velocity\n– Polyphonic legato playback where started notes syncs envelopes with currently playing ones\n– Up to 4 doubling voices with separate pitch, pan and level\n– Filter with modulation possibilities\n– Post Reverb, Delay and EQ   Rev 1: All the new libraries are integrated as one package. The included Analog Synths, Loney Tunes, Lost and Found, Pink Textures, Tuned Percussion & Vintage Organs factory expansion libraries are courtesy of Grand Theft Audio. Rock on! and thank you.

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 26 August 2024 | 23.8MB PLATFORM: WiN64 – VST/VST3/AAX(MODiFiED) Supercharger GT is a compressor inspired by the rich, tube-driven sound of a boutique hardware unit. A feature-rich follow-up to the Supercharger compressor released in December 2013, Supercharger GT goes beyond modern tube compression by adding dedicated Saturation and Character modes and additional controls for complete sonic fine-tuning. Supercharger GT was designed for simple yet comprehensive sound shaping. Producers can quickly dial in a wide range of compression effects using a single ‘Compress’ knob. The effect’s automatic make-up gain allows them to stay focused on the sound of the effect without having to compensate for the drop in volume compression can sometimes cause. Pre-set Attack and Release settings provide a starting point for setting Supercharger GT’s response to incoming signals – producers can start with Punch, Gentle, and Slam modes. Dedicated Attack and Release controls allow an additional degree of fine-tuning.  THE POWER OF TUBE COMPRESSION\n– Gives you the white-hot sound of tube compression\n– Additional saturation and character controls\n– Intuitive, perfectly-nuanced sound shaping Aside from compression, Supercharger GT also delivers a set of tone-shaping controls that make it more than just a compressor effect. A ‘Saturation’ knob with Mild, Crisp, and Slam saturation types give users three ways to add harmonic content to their tracks. At lower settings, Supercharger GT offers subtle harmonic enhancement. At more extreme settings it delivers raw, distorted coloration. The ‘Character’ knob can fill in missing low end and smooth out unruly high frequencies with Fat, Warm, and Aggressive character modes adding to its versatility. Furthermore, a mid/side mode lets producers create space in a mix by applying the effect only to the left and right sides of a signal – perfect for adjusting stereo imaging. A detector high pass prevents unruly low end signals from mis-triggering the compressor. Combined, these features provide producers dynamic control, warmth, and sonic shaping in one convenient plug-in.`,

This is part of our new “Enhanced Classics” series. Compression is one of the most important tools in the arsenal of an Engineer, Music Producer & Artist alike. This is now a device that far surpasses its original intent which was to control the level of the sound automatically. Today we use different types of compressors for inducing a “Vibe” & “Feel” to our instruments, percussion, drums, and voice. Digital and Analog Compressors have come a long way, but some classics are still preferred even today because they are now as much a part of a genre or musical style that they are now deemed as musical instruments in their own right.

The effect is particularly simple to use, with just a few clearly laid-out controls providing a wide range of sounds from subtle warmth to complete devastation. The input knob and convenient visual display allow producers to set exactly the right input level to drive the compressor. Once the input level is set, producers can quickly dial in a wide range of compression effects using a single ‘Compress’ knob. The Compress knob is a macro knob, automatically adjusting multiple parameters including make-up gain, the responsiveness of the release control, and the degree of saturation. This means that each position of the dial provides an ideal setting. Punch and Dirt buttons deliver added impact and saturation. Supercharger complements the existing range of Komplete studio effects with harmonically-rich tube sound, and is optimized for use in Maschine. ﻿﻿`,

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 12 October 2024 | 54.1 MB PLATFORM: AU/CLAP/VSTi/VST3/AAX TAL-Sampler is not just a sample player. It’s a full featured analog modeled synthesizer with a sampler engine as sound source, including a powerful modulation matrix and a high quality self-oscillating 24/12/6 dB low pass filter. Don’t expect a 40GB piano sample library with samples for every velocity or something similar. The idea is to bring back the fun sampling was in the good old times with small samples, fast loading times and an intuitive work-flow to create your own sample presets without getting lost in the settings.  It’s possible to choose between different digital analog converters (DAC’s) to get the vintage sound of different hardware samplers inside your DAW. We don’t make cheap bit crushing or decimation on the output signal. We really down-sample the sample to the desired sampling frequency, then process the data depending on the chosen DAC and up-sample it to the desired pitch. Most DAC modes offer a LEVEL slider. This feature allows the user to reduce the volume of the recorded sample and decreases the sample quality. Load your favorite high quality sample and make it sound vintage and noisy. The 24dB low pass filter will like it! Following diagram shows the signal flow if you choose the DAC Emu II mode:\nThe plug-in has four layers an can play four samples simultaneous. There is also a simple SFZ import for samples that imports the mapping and sample paths, but the plug-in also contains an easy to use mapping editor. TAL-Sampler is available in the VST, Audio Unit and AAX plug-in format. You can load and play your own samples in every common sample format (*.wav, *.aiff, *.aif, *.mp3, *.ogg, *.flac). Import samples with drag & drop from finder or explorer. There is also an intuitive sample browser that helps to find samples fast. Some nice additions like a vintage real-time time stretcher and the possibility to modulate or automate the sample loop positions. Features: Vintage DAC modes (Emu II, AM6070, Sample Hold).Steep 96dB low-pass reconstruction filter (Emu II and AM6070 F).Variable sample rate.Powerful MOD-Matrix.Four sample layers.Three AHDSR envelopes with vintage Digital / RC mode.Three LFO’s (Triangle, Saw, Rectangle, Random, Noise).High Quality effects (Reverb, EQ, Delay).Self resonating zero feedback delay filter (24/12/6 dB LP).Wide range of audio formats supported (*.wav, *.aiff, *.aif, *.mp3, *.ogg, *.flac).Scalable high resolution user interface.The possibility to change font and background colour.Fast sample and preset loading.More than 100 presets available as download (on the right).`,

Sounds and noises\nWe’ve carefully and meticulously recorded high quality samples of each fret of all acoustic guitar strings. RealGuitar sample library includes not only sustain sounds, but also other guitar-specific sounds and noises with dynamics and nuances an experienced performer can get from his/her instrument. Guitar FX Processor\nVersion 6 supports external guitar FX processors which are important to create a realistic guitar part.

Combining a virtual guitar and an FX processor allows you to store a guitar sound and an FX processor preset at the same time, which a real time saver. Techniques and control\nAn authentic sounding guitar part cannot be recorded by using samples on their own, but requires a bunch of guitar-specific techniques, which are simulated in RealGuitar. Whether you are playing live or programing a DAW, these techniques are controllable by using special gestures, key switches, key velocity, modulation wheel, sustain pedal, key aftertouch, MIDI CC, DAW parameter automation, and any combinations of these. Chord voicing\nGuitar chord voicing is very unique depending on guitar construction and is absolutely necessary to reproduce in order to achieve authentically sounding chordal parts. Our patented technology provides accurate reproduction of guitar chord voicing automatically for 30 chord types in all existing inversions, extensions and alterations. Rhythm Patterns\nIn order to record an authentic accompaniment track, most session guitarists carefully study characteristic rhythm parts for the required style. We created a huge rhythm library consisting of 1250 patterns. It can be easily used for quickly creating guitar accompaniment parts in the DAW or in our internal Song sequencer. Realism\nSophisticated humanization algorithms vary samples, technique and control parameters, timing, chord strum aspects to reach best possible realism in guitar tracks. That helps you bring a digitally simulated guitar performance maximally close to an analog recording of a best-in-class session guitarist.

In the early 1960s Rickenbacker® history became forever wedded to one of the biggest music upheavals of the 20th century: the invasion of the mop-top Beatles from Liverpool, England. The Beatles created unprecedented, international interest in Rickenbackers. John Lennon would own at least four models, George Harrison’s double-bound 360/12 (the second one made by the company) defined a new tone at the other end of the audio spectrum. Its ringing sound embellished “You Can’t Do That”, “Eight Days a Week”, “A Hard Day’s Night”, “Ticket To Ride” to name just a few. Jim McGuinn made the bell-like quality of its tone the foundation of the Byrds’ early style. The Who’s Peter Townshend, Creedence Clearwater Revival’s John Fogerty, Steppenwolf’s John Kay, and many other well-known 1960s guitarists became faithful Rickenbacker® users. Groups like Oasis, Pearl Jam, Radiohead, U2, and other of today’s top acts include Rickenbacker® guitars in their musical arsenal. Rickenbacker® is the principal guitar of artists such as R.E.M.’s Peter Buck and Against Me!’s Laura Jane Grace, and many others.  RealRick includes 8 guitar patches:\n– 6-string – Mono\n– 12-string A – Mono, 3rd string pair tuned in OCTAVE\n– 12-string B – Mono, 3rd string pair tuned in UNISON\n– 6-string (Stereo/Double-track):\n– – full Stereo (emulates ‘Rick-O-Sound’ stereo output) when used in RealRick single output version\n– – double tracked patch when used in RealRick two output versions\n– 12-string A and B (Stereo/Mono):\n– – main (sustain) sound is Stereo (6/6 strings split), additional sounds/noises are Mono\n– 12-string A and B (Stereo/Double-track):\n– – full Stereo (emulates ‘Rick-O-Sound’ stereo output) when used in RealRick single output version\n– – double tracked patch when used in RealRick two output versions  A witch says,\nIn the legit version, 96kHz Library does not work because of the wrong registry entry.

The uniqueness comes from the way the Duduk was recorded and further explored in the snapshots.  82 Snapshots:\n– Natural (24) – the Duduk’s various articulations\n– Drones (17) – tonal drones to accompany the Duduk and use for scoring\n– Sound Design (36) – add colour and character to you music\n– Rhythms (4) – for scoring purposes\n– One Clean snapshot for a fresh sound design start Articulations Include:\n– Sustain\n– Sustained Vibrato\n– Full & Half Trill\n– 3 Crescendo types: short, long & vibrato\n– Flutter\n– Ornaments\n– Phrases\n– Crazy, Breath, Crying\n– Falls and Risers\n– Staccato\n– Teeth\n– Percussion & Looped Percussion\n– Alternative Deep Reed Finger Vibration\n– Alternative Deep Reed Sustains and Vibratos\n– Alternative Vibrato Lips In Plus, 26 Drones are included to accompany your ethnic tale. Notes from a Cello, Violin, Shakuhachi, Bamboo Flute, Accordion, Harmonica, two Hulusis, Bawu, Tongue Drums and the Handpan were specifically recorded for this project. Other drones include synthesized and hybrid sounds.  Individual sounds have markings (Like C2 or C4) where on the keyboard the articulation starts. For example “(C2)” indicates the articulation starts at the instrument’s lowest note – C2 note in Kontakt – and most of the natural articulations are programmed 2 upwards on the keyboard. The “Alt Lips In Articulations” meets that rule half way as for maximum creativity you can feel around the 88 key layout. The percussion loops are tempo synced using Time Machine (TM) and are natively programmed at 100bpm.   Requires the FULL Version of Kontakt v7.10.4 and higher!`,

    description: `MOCHA | 17 December 2024 | 11.8MB What is Nudistort? Nudistort is a new algorithm for distortion. But even calling it a distortion is a bit of a misnomer; it’s more of a sound-bender, an auditory calcifier, an ancient froth, an oxidized ear-sword. It sounds like a growling cheetah eating a jar of raw, thick clover honey. Check out some audio examples and demos below.`,

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 07 June 2024 | 37.9MB Behringer launched Vintage, a free analog modeling synth, and the German company’s first synth plugin. However, there’s a twist – the plugin isn’t available for download right now. The Mac and Windows release is a Prophet-inspired synth that Behringer states they modelled on the analogue circuitry of iconic vintage synths. However there’s been a bit of a hiccup with the release, and the product page and download link for the plugin went dead shortly after going live, which we’ll cover in more detail below.  The plugin has two multi-wave oscillators (sine, saw and square), which are analog-modeled, as well as a sub-oscillator and hard-sync function. There is also a noise generator with a color parameter that controls the lowpass cutoff, and you can modulate the pulse width on the square wave oscillator. The Vintage synthesizer has two filters that offer 12/24 dB switchable highpass, lowpass, bandpass, and formant modes, as well as selectable drive curves for harmonic saturation. The release allows for serial or parallel filtering, as you can mod the filter routing. There are dozens of factory presets for the synth included, covering a wide range of sounds, as well as the ability to select favorites and save your own presets. Behringer has made Vintage available via free download, which you can get after clicking through to get a free licence and registering with Behringer’s Music Tribe community. After that, you’ll get a serial number that allows you to register the standalone build of the Vintage. If Vintage users choose to make a donation to Behringer, the funds will go toward the Playing For Change Foundation, which builds art and music schools for children around the world. There seems to be some funny business going on at Behringer at the moment, however, as the synth was available from the company’s website, but now the product page has been deleted. There are already several demos of the plugin in action on YouTube, so it went live at some point. However, the exact status of the release is now unknown. It’s not clear if Behringer is simply fixing a minor issue with its website or if the entire release has been delayed or perhaps even canceled altogether. Some users have speculated that Behringer did not anticipate the level of demand the release would have, and the plugin is unavailable simply because the servers crashed.`,

    description: `DiSCOVER | 17 December 2018 | 1.16 GB The GS Ambient Toolkit contains 5 wonderful kontakt libraries from Genera Studios in one bundle.  This Bundle Includes:\n• Ambient Tape Machines\n• Lush Atmosphere\n• Spooky Chorus\n• Spooky Piano\n• Taps  ……:::::: Ambient Tape Machines – OVERVIEW ::::::……\nAmbient Tape Machines: C1 was created by first capturing 3 unique raw sets of samples, recording them onto cassette tape, and then playing them back at full and half speed on a vintage Library Of Congress C1 cassette player. Analog tape helps give music a certain warmth that is hard to emulate in the digital world, and playing back sounds at half speed on tape is a truly incredible experience. Ambient Tape Machines: C1 allows you to blend and control these lush sounds so you can sculpt the perfect ambient soundscape. ……:::::: INCLUDED ::::::……\n• Total Sample Size – 805MB\n• 184 Samples\n• Over 70 Snapshot Presets\n• Intuitive GUI with Plenty of Control\n• Custom Dual Arpeggiators\n• Open script for all you KSP scripters out there! ……:::::: FEATURES ::::::……\n• 3 sound sources with volume, pan, tuning, and tape speed controls\n• Two ADSR’s for VCA and VCF (with VCF ENV depth)\n• Switchable LFO synced to your host tempo (with mod depth)\n• Vibrato depth and rate control\n• 4-pole LPF and HPF\n• Delay, Reverb, and Saturation Controls\n• Custom dual arpeggiators for LPF cutoff and resonance\n• Recorded at 24-Bit and 48kHz\n• Requirements: Native Instruments Kontakt 5.8.1+ or higher. ……:::::: I N T E R F A C E ::::::…… ……:::::: THE TAPE ::::::……\nThe Library of Congress C1 Cassette player is a vintage piece of gear originally intended for the vision impaired to listen to audio books from the Library of Congress. Its unique variable speed playback controls make it a very powerful ambient sound creation tool. The unit used in this instrument seems to introduce a slight slow-down, some noise, and some wobbling at half speed – giving these samples a truly unique sonic fingerprint. To reduce the noise the samples were de-noised using industry standard tools, but to maintain the integrity of the raw sound we purposefully left some noise in. The samples were tuned in Kontakt to counter the slight slow-down effect of the tape machine. ……:::::: THE SOUNDS ::::::……\nThere are 3 unique raw sample sets in Ambient Tape Machines: C1. These are broken down by Digital, Analog, and Acoustic. The Digital sound was produced using a modern digital synthesizer performing virtual analog synthesis. The Analog sound was captured from a 3 oscillator analog mono-synth set on a huge/ambient patch. The Acoustic sound was captured from an electric guitar playing palm muted notes through a clean patch on an Axe-FX II XL+ with some very lush shimmer reverb applied.  Through the GUI you will be able to change the play back speed between full and half, tune them, set the volume, and pan each of the sounds individually. Each sound is incredibly detailed on its own, but the real magic happens when you blend them together in creative ways. ……:::::: Presets And Collaboration ::::::……\nTo show you the potential of what Ambient Tape Machines C1 can do, we teamed up with two excellent musicians and sound designers to create over 70 presets. Jetfire Prime and Franklin Vanderhyde contributed incredible patches that compliment the patches we came up with, and pushed the instrument into new sonic landscapes we never thought of. This was primarily an ambient instrument, but you can also create more traditional lead, bass, and synth patches. ……:::::: Presets Breakdown ::::::……\n• 29 Ambiences\n• 04 Arps\n• 15 FX\n• 11 Lead\n• 09 PL\n• 03 Synths ……:::::: DEMO PREViEW ::::::……  ……:::::: Lush Atmosphere – OVERVIEW ::::::……\nLush Atmosphere is an ambient Kontakt Library featuring 3 ambient instruments, and a master patch to mix and control them. Lush Atmosphere will be the secret sauce you throw in your mixes to add that lush ethereal sound. ……:::::: IN DETAIL ::::::……\n• 270 Files – 650MB\n• 3 Ambient Kontakt Instruments\n• Lush stRings\n• Lush Elements\n• Lush Pluck\n• 19 Presets NKI’s\n• Master Control Patch\n• Individual level, pan, filter, and ADSR settings\n• 10 snapshots\n• Recorded at 24-Bit and 44.1kHz\n• Requirements: Native Instruments Kontakt 5.8.1+ or higher. ……:::::: I N T E R F A C E ::::::…… ……:::::: DEMO PREViEW ::::::…… ……:::::: Spooky Chorus –  OVERVIEW ::::::……\nSpooky Chorus is Kontakt Instrument created by making convolution IR responses out of vocal notes, and then routing noise through each sample to make an atmospheric choir sound. As a second set of sounds, the original samples were then fed through a shimmer reverb to create an even more atmospheric sound. As a third set of sounds, a spooky transient layer was added. The GUI of Spooky Chorus was designed to be very graphical. It can be divided into two  local and global. The local parameters are made up of 2 XY Pads so the user can graphically place the instrument in both space and frequency. The global parameters are made up of traditional sliders. A second tabbed page gives arpeggiator controls. ……:::::: INCLUDED ::::::……\n• 1 Kontakt Instrument – 100MB\n• 22 Samples\n• 13 Snapshot Presets\n• Clean Simple GUI with Arpeggiator\n• Recorded at 24-Bit and 44.1kHz\n• Requirements: Native Instruments Kontakt 5.8.1+ or higher. ……:::::: I N T E R F A C E ::::::…… ……:::::: DETAILS ::::::……\nOur mission with Spooky Chorus was to minimize the amount of knobs and sliders without losing any control. The bulk of the UI is made up of 2 XY pads, each containing the 3 unique sounds. You can drag around the sounds on the Volume / Pan Pad to position the instrument in space, and then drag the sounds on the Cutoff/Saturation Pad to position the instrument in frequency content. The remaining sliders control the global parameters of the instrument in a more traditional manner. ……:::::: Arpeggiator ::::::……\nSpooky Chorus comes with a second tab on the GUI that gives you access to an arpeggiator. This is a stock NI preset arpeggiator, but it gives you access to a completely different way to play the instrument. Our favorite mode is random, with the rate set to high speeds – this creates a flurry of notes around whatever chord or groups of notes you’re playing. ……:::::: Spooky Presets ::::::……\nSpooky Chorus comes with 13 snapshot presets to get you started. We found that Spooky Chorus performed best in 3 core areas: the main sounds (resembling a distant choir), the spooky sounds (ghostly artifacts), and fast arpeggiated sounds (to create a wash of sound). Note that if you want to use the snapshots in the drop-down menu on Spooky Chorus, you must move the snapshot folder into your Kontakt snapshot folder. There are instructions for how to do this in the README file included with the download. ……:::::: DEMO/PREViEW ::::::……  ……:::::: Spooky Piano -OVERVIEW ::::::……\nSpooky Piano is Kontakt Instrument created by making convolution IR responses out of notes from a synthesized piano, and then routing noise through each sample to make an atmospheric piano sound. As a second set of sounds, the original samples were then fed through saturation and reverb to create an even more atmospheric sound. As a third set of sounds, a single sample was mapped across the keyboard to create spooky artifacts that add an additional transient to the instrument. The GUI of Spooky Piano was designed to be very graphical. It can be divided into two  local and global. The local parameters are made up of 2 XY Pads so the user can graphically place the instrument in both space and frequency. The global parameters are made up of traditional sliders. A second tabbed page gives arpeggiator controls. ……:::::: DETAILS ::::::……\n• 1 Kontakt Instrument – 260MB\n• 72 Samples\n• 16 Snapshot Presets\n• Clean Simple GUI with Arpeggiator\n• Open script\n• Recorded at 24-Bit and 44.1kHz\n• Requirements: Native Instruments Kontakt 5.8.1+ or higher. ……:::::: GRAPHICAL UI ::::::……\n\nOur mission with Spooky Piano was to minimize the amount of knobs and sliders without losing any control. The bulk of the UI is made up of 2 XY pads, each containing the 3 unique sounds. You can drag around the sounds on the Volume/Pan Pad to position the instrument in space, and then drag the sounds on the Cutoff/Saturation Pad to position the instrument in frequency content. The remaining sliders control the global parameters of the instrument in a more traditional manner. ……:::::: ARPEGGIATOR ::::::……\n\nSpooky Piano comes with a second tab on the GUI that gives you access to an arpeggiator. This is a stock NI preset arpeggiator, but it gives you access to a completely different way to play the instrument. Our favorite mode is random, with the rate set to high speeds – this creates a flurry of notes around whatever chord or groups of notes you’re playing. ……:::::: SPOOKY PRESETS ::::::……\nSpooky Piano comes with 16 snapshot presets to get you started. We found that Spooky Piano performed best in 3 core areas: the main sounds (resembling a atmospheric piano), the spooky sounds (twisted sounds barely resembling a piano), and fast arpeggiated sounds. Note that if you want to use the snapshots in the drop-down menu on Taps, you must move the snapshot folder into your Kontakt snapshot folder. There are instructions for how to do this in the (.README) file included with the download.  ……:::::: Taps – OVERVIEW ::::::……\nTaps is a Kontakt Guitar Instrument created from tapped notes on a clean electric guitar, with an octave of low open plucked notes on the bottom end. The result is a very playable sample instrument with a diverse sound that can go between chill and ambient to chaotic and heavy. The GUI includes controls for delay, reverb, saturation, distortion, LPF, and ADSR. Theirs also a built in arpeggiator tab. There are 25 snapshot presets included to get you started, but we think you’ll find the possibilities are endless. ……:::::: DETAILS ::::::……\n• 1 Kontakt Instrument – 58MB\n• 37 Samples\n• 25 Snapshot Presets\n• Clean Simple GUI with Arpeggiator\n• Open script\n• Recorded at 24-Bit and 44.1kHz\n• Recorded on an Ibanez RGA8 with EMG808X pickups through an Axe-FX II XL+\n• Requirements: Native Instruments Kontakt 5.8.1+ or higher. ……:::::: LOT’S OF CONTROL ::::::…… Our mission with Taps was to create the biggest diversity in sounds possible with the smallest amount of samples. The raw sounds include a bottom octave of low notes played with a pick, and the remaining octaves are tapped notes – all on a clean electric guitar. Through the use of the delay, reverb, grit, filter, humanization, and ADSR modules (and the arpeggiator on the second tab), you can play anything from an ambient pad to a crazy helicopter sound.  When making a sample instrument you can usually take two distinct paths; deep sampling for realism (many velocity layers and round-robins), or focusing on sound design. We aimed to focus on sound design (deep sampling is often a wasted effort if you’re just going to cover it in delay, reverb, distortion, and filtering). The result was a super efficient 58MB size Kontakt instrument with a ton of capability, that we can afford to offer for a great price. ……:::::: PLENTY OF PRESETS ::::::……\n\nTaps comes with 25 snapshot presets to get you started. The first 9 presets are what we consider ‘standard’ sounds, not too far away from the raw tone of the samples – use these if you want Taps to sound like a clean tapped electric guitar. The remaining presets are a mix of arpeggiated sounds, distorted guitar sounds, and crazy FX.  Note that if you want to use the snapshots in the drop-down menu on Taps, you must move the snapshot folder into your Kontakt snapshot folder. There are instructions for how to do this in the README file included with the download. ……:::::: ARPEGGIATOR ::::::……\n\nTaps comes with a second tab on the GUI that gives you access to an arpeggiator. This is a stock NI preset arpeggiator, but it gives you access to a completely different way to play the instrument. Our favorite mode is random, with the rate set to high speeds – this creates a flurry of notes around whatever chord or groups of notes you’re playing.`,

    description: `Team ViP | 16 December 2024 | 7.37 GB Discover Scandi string textures with Liikkuva Produce subtle, undulating string textures with LIIKKUVA. Based on the sound of modern “Scandic” or “Nordic” soundtracks such as The Killing, Wallander and Bordertown LIIKKUVA offers a range of high & low string articulations which are perfect for crafting scores that require a sense of movement and evolution. Liikkuva (prounounced “Lee Koo Vah”) is a string textures sample library based on the sound of modern “Scandi” or “Nordic” soundtracks such as The Killing, Wallander and Bordertown. It contains a range of articulations split into “High Strings” and “Low Strings” that all have a sense of movement and evolution. These string textures reflect the landscape of Scandinavian countries – cold, bleak and empty yet are perfect for use in both cold, dreary underscore as well as more warm and shimmering tracks. Discover the allure of Liikkuva – a meticulously crafted string textures library capturing the essence of Scandinavian soundtracks. Recorded by a small string orchestra in a beautiful Croatian church, every note resonates with raw, organic depth, reflecting the serene yet stark landscapes of the Nordic region.  Organic, Raw and Silky Strings with No Violas for the Scandi Sound\nTo create the “Scandi” sound, we recorded a small string orchestra with no violas to scoop out the mid-range and give them their silky sound with a boomy bottom and airy top. The strings are soft and delicate with a silky airiness and distinctly raw, icy tone to them. They have a definite up close sound allowing many intricate details to shine through. From nose diving “Sirens” to more minimalist, melancholic textures like “Sul Tasto“, we’ve recorded a range of textured string techniques in both high and low strings to give you a nuanced, moving sound full of detail and ambience. This library lends itself perfectly to modern drama that requires an intimate and organic sound full of movement and life. It can bring you to both warm, shimmering lakes as well as dark, cold, sharp glaciers. Molto Flautando\nPlay with a very soft, airy bowing technique, creating a flute-like, whispery sound that is delicate and ethereal. Molto Flautando Bowed Vibrato\nPlay very close to the bridge with intense vibrato, producing a sharp, metallic tone with a haunting vibrato effect. Molto Sul Pont Bowed Vibrato\nPlay very close to the bridge with intense vibrato, producing a sharp, metallic tone with a haunting vibrato effect. Molto Sul Pont Tremolo\nPerform rapid back-and-forth bowing near the bridge to create a trembling, metallic sound with heightened intensity. Octave Sweeps\nGlide smoothly between octaves, creating a sweeping effect that moves fluidly across the instrument’s range. Plucks Alternating\nAlternate between different strings or pitches with a plucking technique, generating rhythmic, percussive textures. Ricochet Soundscape\nBounce the bow off the strings, creating a rhythmic, bouncing sound that adds a dynamic, textured layer to the music. Sirens\nGlide smoothly up and down in pitch, mimicking the wailing of a siren for a dramatic, oscillating effect. Spiccato Soundscape\nUse a bouncing bow technique with a light, short stroke to create a staccato, textured sound that adds rhythmic interest. Sul Pont\nPlay near the bridge to produce a bright, glassy tone with a focused, penetrating sound that emphasizes higher harmonics. Sul Tasto\nBow over the fingerboard for a soft, muted tone that has a warm, gentle quality, often used for subtle, delicate passages. Tremolo Soundscape\nPerform rapid back-and-forth bowing to create a shimmering, continuous sound, adding tension and energy to the music. Varied Tremolo\nCombine different speeds and dynamics of tremolo to create a varied, evolving texture that shifts in intensity and character. Beautiful Minimalist Interface With 3 Mic Positions\nLIIKKUVA features a simple, easy to use GUI with a minimalist set of controls. On the interface you’ll find:\n– 3 Mic Positions – Close, Mid, Far\n– Release volume knob\n– Reverb – length & mix\n– Dynamic slider – allowing you to crossfade between dynamic layers\n– Sus Attack & Decay\n– Rel Attack & Decay   FULL retail version of Kontakt v5.8.1 or later is required!`,

Building on the success of the original Arcturus Kontakt Instrument, Arcturus Nano retains all the cherished sounds that have made it a staple in the studios of composers worldwide, while introducing advanced features designed to enhance your creative workflow.

    description: `TEAM HCiSO | 10 October 2024 | 938.77 MB Max is a graphical environment for music, audio, and multimedia. In use for over twenty years by performers, composers, artists, scientists, teachers, and students, Max is the way to make your computer do things that reflect your individual ideas and dreams.  OBJECTS\nEach object does something. Max has objects that generate sound waves, represent hardware, or provide a UI for interaction. PATCHCORDS\nPatchcords connect one object to another. This connection lets objects share their output with connected objects. CONTROL\nConnect UI objects like dials and sliders to provide control values or display results. Modulate, map and scale data to get just the right results. Create Software Built Around You, In the Moment\n• Drag in your own audio clips and start manipulating them and connecting effects\n• Map your patcher with MIDI controllers as you go to start playing with your creation while you work Expanded Ideas\nMax patching starts on a blank canvas, free of any structure. This makes it natural to build and explore unique ideas that would be too complex to make elsewhere. The Max patcher automatically expands to fit your work as it grows, no matter how much space you take up. Explore Sound without Limits\n• Design a custom synthesizer with as many oscillators and effects as you wish.\n• Manipulate samples in every way, including timestretch and pitch shifting.\n• Build up more layered sounds using MC objects to patch multichannel audio. Make Sound with a Gesture\nIn Max, you can build classic synths from scratch or get lost hacking together unusual sounds. Try the XY controls below to hear some sounds you could create with Max.\n• You can do a lot with just a single oscillator and a filter.\n• Add some extra modulation and try something a little more wild. Make Visual Music\nMax includes full-featured, expandable video and graphics tools with Jitter. Jitter is optimized for realtime audiovisual work, and is easy to combine with audio, sequencing, and modulation like everything else in Max. Take Max into the World\nMax patching starts on a blank canvas, free of any structure. This makes it natural to build and explore unique ideas that would be too complex to make elsewhere. The Max patcher automatically expands to fit your work as it grows, no matter how much space you take up. Prototype and Evaluate\nFlexible access to hardware makes Max a perfect environment for prototyping. Connect your development board to Max and get instant access to sensors, knobs, and switches. Watch the data stream in as you develop the interaction. Countless commercial products, art installations, and stage shows have relied on Max to glue together all the parts of their process. Generate Audio, Video, Code\nUse Gen to patch together fine-tuned processes for audio, matrix data, or texture processing. Gen lets you combine procedural commands with visual patching to simplify the creation of custom processes. Gen objects can also output source code to be used elsewhere if needed. Extended Max\nMax’s built-in Package Manager offers immediate access to over 50 add-ons covering everything from computer vision to support for hardware controllers including Novation, Monome and ROLI controllers. If the feature you want doesn’t exist in Max, chances are someone in the community has created it. And if they haven’t, you can extend Max yourself using C++, NodeJS, Java, or javascript. → Introducing RNBO\nRNBO is a new patching environment built to export software with the sound of Max. Create web experiences, hardware music devices, audio plugins, and new Max objects all from the same patch. And when that’s not enough, RNBO generates source code that you can use however you want. This Was Made in RNBO\nThe example below was patched in RNBO and exported to Web Audio. RNBO Web Export also provides easy access to your patcher’s interactive elements and seamlessly integrates with your HTML/javascript code to add rich sonic experiences.

    description: `Team ViP | 15 December 2024 | 4.95GB A new chapter for Poiesis Cello is here… Since its release in 2021, Poiesis Cello has become a firm favourite amongst composers and sound designers and now we’re very pleased to announce the arrival of Poiesis Cello 2! ‘Poiesis’ describes the act of bringing something new into existence, and that’s certainly true of the unique sounds in this beautifully unconventional instrument. Brimming with rich timbral shifts and delicate shadings, octave harmonics, bow bounces and reiterations, Poiesis Cello can produce dynamic textures which range from tender and reflective to nervily unsettling.  New in Poiesis Cello 2…\nNow hosted in our bespoke Aria Engine, Poiesis Cello 2 brings new possibilities to this expressive instrument. Featuring the same sample content as the original version, this update expands your creative control: crossfade or stack articulations, add effects from the extensive effects library, apply filters to each layer, and create evolving soundscapes using the intuitive XY pad. This version also includes close to 100 new presets providing a great starting point for shaping your own unique sound. Poiesis Cello 2 is now organised as two different instruments… The sound.\nPoiesis Cello was recorded in a dry studio with three high-end microphones placed relatively close to the instrument, to offer an intimate sound that you can shape as you please. The microphones used are a Neumann U87 large diaphragm condenser (LDC), an AEA R84A ribbon (RBN) and a Schoeps CMC/mk4 small diaphragm condenser (SDC).A pre-rendered stereo mix (MIX) with the single microphones in LCR position and additional processing is also included and it provides a ready-to-use, resource-friendly way to obtain a great sound, right out of the box. The instrument recorded is a 1995 Moes & Moes cello built for and owned by Yo-Yo Ma and played by Alan Black, principal cellist with the Charlotte Symphony Orchestra. The patches.\nPoiesis Cello features two different patches:\nTextures is a two-layer instrument that allows you to choose between any of the 43 included articulations for each of the layers and freely crossfade between them using your keyboard’s mod-wheel (midi CC#1).\nShorts is a complementary patch that features three velocity-sensitive short articulations sampled with 5 round robins and 3 dynamic layers (+ snap pizz. on the pizzicato articulation. Full articulations list:\n1 – Textures\nOrdinario:\n– normale\n– supersoft poco vibrato\n– Con Sordino mp\n– Trem Sul Tasto pp\n– Trem mp\n– Trem f\n– Con Sord Trem p\n– Con Sord Trem f Sul Tasto:\n– Sul Tasto mp\n– Sul Tasto f\n– Con Sord Sul Tasto mp\n– Con Sord Sul Tasto f Sul Ponticello:\n– Sul Pont mp\n– Sul Pont f\n– Con Sord Sul Pont mp\n– Con Sord Sul Pont f Harmonics:\n– Harmonics p\n– Harmonics mf\n– Con Sord Harmonics p\n– Con Sord Harmonics mf Textural:\n– Textural Rebowed\n– Textural Sparse\n– Textural Medium\n– Textural Dense Tratto & Extended Techniques:\n– Col legno tratto\n– Play Behind Bridge\n– Pluck Behind Bridge\n– Circular Bowing\n– Bow on Tailpiece Motions:\n– Motions 1/2\n– Motions 1/4\n– Motions 1/8\n– Motions 1/12\n– Sul tasto Motions 1/2\n– Sul tasto Motions 1/4\n– Sul tasto Motions 1/8\n– Sul tasto Motions 1/12\n– Sul pont Motions 1/2\n– Sul pont Motions 1/4\n– Sul pont Motions 1/8\n– Sul pont Motions 1/12 Flautando:\n– Flautando mp\n– Con Sord Flautando mp 2 – Shorts:\n– Spiccato\n– Staccato\n– Pizzicato (velocity=127 triggers Bartok pizz.)

    description: `BUBBiX | 15 December 2024 | 10 MB Speldosa (Swedish for “Music Box”) is the essence of the shared beliefs, and their fascination with minimalism. A simple melody played on a music box can contain an equal amount of emotional power as any symphonic work. There is something about the music box sound that never ceases to fascinate. The instrument itself has been meticulously recorded by Wintergatan and transformed into a playable digital instrument plugin. It features four different models (Modern, Vintage, Antique, and Eternal = Reversed), two different Room models, and an algorithmic reverb. Box went on to become the sonic signature for my two bands, Detektivbyrån and Wintergatan, both recognised for their unique sound. The Speldosa has been the secret sauce in my music career and i hope other musicians finds it as useful as i have.  Features:\n•Four different instrument models\n•Two different room simulations\n•Algorithmic reverb\n•Simple UI\n•Carefully recorded samples.   Speldosa v1.0.3:\n– Damper control setting\n– In this new update of Speldosa v1.0.3 , Klevgrand have added damping possibilites to provide even more tonal variations and to enhance playability even more. The popularity of Speldosa truly proves that there’s something uniquely special about the sound of this music box. Its sounds never fail to fascinate, and now, thanks to this update, they’ve made it even more flexible—making it even more useful in a variety of musical contexts.\n– Adjust the Damper slider to control note damping, offering versatile tonal variations and enhanced playability.`,

    description: `Team ViP | 06 January 2025 | 10.46GB The library can naturally be used on its own. But when combined with other titles from the Virtuoso Japanese Series — such as KOTO 13 Version 2, KOTO 17, or SHAKUHACHI — as well as orchestral instruments, KOTO 20 can complete a rich and broad ensemble. As a historical note, the 20-string koto was conceived by Keiko Nosaka in 1969. Initially, this koto was strung with 20 strings, but in later iterations, another string was added to make it a 21-string instrument.  Main Features:​\n– NKS ready and Kontakt Player compatible.\n– Near-perfect recreation of every performance nuance from the 21-string koto thanks to meticulous recording techniques and innovative programming.\n– Exclusive Performance mode maps the 21 strings to adjacent white keys for easy performance of real koto glissandos and phrases.\n– 18 key-switch-selectable articulations fundamental to the 21-string koto.\n– Sustain pedal control for natural continuous-picking phrasing.\n– Newly developed Instrument Modeler reproduces sound variations due to different fingerpicks and strings.\n– Character selector lets you choose from three fingerpick thicknesses.\n– String tone selector offers three string tones: Thick, Normal, and Thin.\n– Includes three banks of quintessential koto phrases, all key-switch controllable.\n– Plucking control function for full mastery over subtle, natural sounding picked notes.\n– String editor enables independent tuning adjustments for all 21 strings.\n– In addition to the 10 preset scales, the User Scale mode lets you create original scales.\n– All samples recorded in 24-bit / 96 kHz high resolution to capture every tonal detail.\n– Create your own mixes with the multi-microphone samples and a dedicated mixer with individual controls for Direct, Overhead, Room, and Stereo Mix channels. Designed to capture the sound and expressive power of the 20-stringed koto\nString editor enables independent tuning adjustments for all 21 strings. The koto is played by adjusting the tuning of the 21 strings for each musical piece to be performed. KOTO 20 has a Scale Performance mode to map the tones of each string to 21 adjacent white keys. This lets the performer access the instrument in the most realistic way possible. KOTO 20 is packed with 18 different articulations to recreate the koto’s vast range of musical expressions. These include different nuances created by playing with the thumb, index, or middle finger as well as glissandos, tremolo picking, and even chirashizume pick scrapes. All articulations can be controlled independently with key switches. The three KOTO 20 phrase banks contain special techniques that are difficult to reproduce, ranging from classic koto techniques such as glissandos and surizume to sound effects made by striking the bridges. Phrase banks are selectable with key switches and can be triggered from a MIDI keyboard. You can control the pitch and tempo of each phrase bank as well. Instrument Modeler reproduces sound variations from different fingerpicks and strings\nThe tonal characteristics of the koto vary a lot depending on the fingerpick and string thickness used. To faithfully reproduce these variations, we developed a new function called the Instrument Modeler. With the Instrument Modeler, you can adjust individual parameters, including the fingerpick and string thickness (Thick, Normal, and Thin), the pitch and attack of note transients, and noise components. This functionality makes it possible to control the character of the sound any way you like, from a natural playing feel to very aggressive performances. Alternate picking articulations and sustain pedal control for natural continuous-picking phrasing​\nThe library comes with three alternate picking articulations to recreate the natural sound variations that occur while playing a succession of pick strokes. Alternate picking can be switched with key switches or the sustain pedal control. This function makes it easy to reproduce realistic tremolo picking. With the sustain pedal control on, you can switch between normal picking with key on events and alternate picking with key off events. String editor enables independent tuning adjustments for all 21 strings\nThe library comes with 10 frequently used scales (Chromatic, Ionian, Natural Minor, Harmonic Minor, Melodic Minor, Dorian, Phrygian, Lydian, Mixolydian, Whole Tone), including a chromatic scale. You can perform many musical pieces with the presets and the key transposition function. The additional User Scale mode lets you create custom scales for specific compositions. When creating a custom scale, you can set the volume and panning for each string as well as fine tune each string. – User scales\nBy customizing all 21 strings, you can set up scales for specific tunes or for your original compositions, allowing you to incorporate koto elements into any piece of music. Custom scales are saved as user scales and can be recalled at any time. Note: User scales cannot be transposed. Multi-microphone samples in full 24-bit / 96 kHz high resolution\nThe recordings were made with the utmost care, using more than eight microphones of various types together with colorless mic preamps. All library samples were recorded in 24-bit / 96 kHz high definition to faithfully capture the entirety of the koto’s delicate expressions.\nThe samples were recorded with three stereo microphone positions — Direct, Overhead, and Room — plus a Stereo Mix. Full mixing control is available, with individual Volume, Pan, Reverb Send, and EQ adjustments for each channel. The parallel output bus sends the microphone channels to individual DAW tracks for finer mixing sessions.\nThe library comes with 30 convolution reverbs, including two impulse responses from a Noh theater renowned among musicians for its acoustics. The convolution reverbs permit high-quality in-instrument sound creation.\nLoad manager reduces memory usage for smoother production work\nWith the load manager, the performer can choose to load only the desired articulations. Skipping unnecessary samples obtains smoother performance from the Kontakt engine. MIDI Groove Browser\nKOTO 20 features the incredibly useful Groove Browser, that lets you quickly find MIDI grooves and drag & drop grooves directly into your DAW. You can adjust the grooves’ velocity, swing, playback tempo, and other parameters directly from KONTAKT / KOMPLETE KONTROL. The library comes standard with 20 MIDI grooves, including short phrases that showcase what the instrument is capable of. When combined with the soon-to-be-released Groove Inspirations MIDI pack, the Groove Browser gives you access to an extensive phrase bank.   Works with NI Kontakt Player v6.6 and higher!`,

Each pattern contains events, with individual parameters like pitch, velocity (as in how fast the instrument is shaken), and envelope. With full control over shuffle/swing amount, an advanced humanizer function, internal awareness of in- and out shakes (yes, they sound different), using grids divided into triplets/quintuplets/septuplets, timing fine-tuning and variable sequence lengths, Skaka can get very close to how a human percussionist would sound in almost any tempo without any use of degrading time stretching or similar techniques.  Features:\n– 12 parallel slots, each with individual settings for instrument and pattern\n– 8 different shaker instruments (Egg, Shaker, Tambourine, Caxixi, Single Shot, Ghungroos, Calabash & Seeds\n– High quality reverb plus room simulation\n– High-precision editing of each pattern, with a plethora of controls for getting the exact right timing, pitch and velocity\n– Wide range of presets covering most genres and styles\n– Advanced and customizable humanizer\n– 8 (or 9) velocity layers with more than 30 round-robins per layer for each instrument (thousands of samples used) v1.2.0:\n– Added 6 more instruments.\n– Half and double time options.\n– Window Resize (desktop only)  To top it off, there’s a nice reverb, a room simulator and a high shelf filter. Skaka comes with nearly 200 ready-made patterns covering most genres and styles.`,

    description: `FANTASTiC | 06 January 2025 | 2.88 GB Of all the new features in Ableton Live 12, the MIDI Generators are perhaps the most revolutionary, providing the ability to not only transform MIDI notes in unique ways but also generate them, in order to instantly create a multitude of different patterns. This has the potential to radically transform the workflows and compositional processes of everyone from beginners right through to more advanced producers. On this new masterclass from Course Director and Certified Ableton Live Trainer Rob Jones, you’ll learn to fully get to grips with all of the MIDI Generators on offer, as well as acquire a wealth of new techniques and inspiration for how to implement them in your production. The course starts with a few lessons that tackle the general operational features and quirks of these new devices, all of which reside on the generator tab within the MIDI Editor. These aim to teach the basics when it comes to note generation, to help with understanding what they act on and when and how they can be made to create patterns. This leads to the first tool, Rhythm, which is introduced slowly via a demonstration of how very simple drum patterns are made, helping ferment a good knowledge of the main pattern controls on all tools of step length, pattern length and density. Once the basics are out the way, there’s a detailed look at a number of different practical uses of Rhythm, showing different approaches for making interesting percussion grooves, before looking exclusively at velocity handling.  In the following module, Rob dives into Stacks, a tool that makes chord and chord progression creation simpler than ever. Starting slowly in the first lesson, there’s an explanation of the controls on offer and how they’re used to select and modify chords, whilst the next lesson picks up the pace and shows the creation of a more complex chord sequence. Rob then moves onto the last 2 main generators – Shape and Seed – both used to create melodies for the most part, although Seed has the ability to produce multiple voices in combination for dense, evolving harmonies. The 2 lessons walk through every part of each tool, showing all the functionality and various directions they can both go in. The final main module is a lengthy set of lessons that put everything into practice by showing seven separate examples of composition, including a whole host of percussion, bass, lead and atmos creation. Despite mainly focussing on the generation and transformation of MIDI notes using tools, there are also many tips for using instruments and effects within Live to make the most of each process, helping to improve sound design, mixing and effects skills along the way. A bonus lesson on Euclidean is also included, giving an intro to the tool and showing a number of techniques for making unique basslines. Enrolling on the course gives students instant access to 4 hours of streamed tutorials plus the Live projects from the lessons, so sign up now to master these incredible new tools and level up your MIDI programming skills today. Course Breakdown\nIntroduction\nRob welcomes you to the course, with some comments about the lesson structure, content and pace. 3.35 Module 1 – MIDI Generators Basics\nA guide to the general functionality of the tools, including different ways of generating patterns, the areas of a clip and notes a tool acts on and some different ways of adjusting parameters. 10.57 Module 2 – Rhythm\nA comprehensive set of lessons working through the first generator, Rhythm, starting with an example of how to make a basic beat and then more likely scenarios of creating interesting percussion grooves. The last lesson is dedicated entirely to the velocity controls, which open the device up to many highly usable situations.\n•Lesson 1 – Getting started with Rhythm – 11.54\n•Lesson 2 – Creating interesting percussion – 15.41\n•Lesson 3 – Velocity controls – 11.30 Module 3 – Stacks\nA thorough look at the next generator, Stacks, for making chords and chord progressions. The first lesson introduces all the controls and operational features, whilst the second one extends this with an example of how to make a more complex chord progression.\n•Lesson 1 – Introduction to Stacks – 15.43\n•Lesson 2 – Making Complex Chord Progressions – 18.13 Module 4 – Shape and Seed\nA rundown of the last 2 main generators, Shape and Seed, going into their similarities and differences and showing how they can be used to make different melodic ideas.\n•Lesson 1 – Introduction to Shape – 12.36\n•Lesson 2 – Introduction to Seed – 11.01 Module 5 – Sound Design Examples\nA series of different examples of how to combine various generators and transformers to create a range of unique percussive and melodic patterns.\n•Lesson 1 – Natural Bongos – 16.28\n•Lesson 2 – Arp-style Bass – 14.05\n•Lesson 3 – 303 Lead – 16.19\n•Lesson 4 – Berlin Chop Lead – 26.29\n•Lesson 5 – Mighty String Lead – 11.26\n•Lesson 6 – Seed Atmos Layer – 12.06\n•Lesson 7 – Longer Melodies – 06.59 Bonus Module 6 – Euclidean\nA bonus lesson on the last generator, Euclidean, including a guide to the operational features and then techniques for using it to create awesome basslines. 22.03`,

    description: `HiDERA | 06 January 2025 | 253 MB Wondering how to get that big studio rock sound with a meager setup? Well, mixing wiz Alberto has a mixing rock video course designed just for you! In this mixing course, you’ll learn many techniques and tips for getting great sounds out of less-than-perfect-sounding tracks, all of which can be applied in numerous scenarios, regardless of genre. By the end of this mixing rock course, you’ll be raring to go and tackle that tricky mix that you thought was a lost cause. These videos are designed for intermediate-level mix engineers. Alberto begins by discussing what he’s going to be covering in the course, so you’ll know exactly what you can expect. Then it’s on to drums, where you’ll learn how to create a killer-sounding drum foundation by enhancing the sounds and/or triggering/layering samples while still retaining a human feel. Guitars and bass follow, and Alberto takes you all the way from raw DI tracks to phenomenal-sounding full tones using a few surprises along the way. Next, you’ll explore the idea of setting up a virtual analog console, which is an excellent workflow in this style, as it can provide some useful limitations and add an interesting sonic character to the proceedings. The rest of the course will continue to cover other important topics, such as the mix bus (adding processing to help glue the tracks, etc.), parallel compression on the drums (for added energy and vibe), and vocals (providing space and clarity among the instrumental track).  It’s easy to hide behind less expensive gear and blame any sonic shortcomings on it, but that doesn’t have to be the way! In this fun, engaging mixing rock course, you’ll learn how to make lemonade out of sonic lemons and get sounds you can be proud of! Check out the individual video tutorial descriptions for more information on everything that’s covered and to see how these ideas can help turn your rock mixes around. Don’t let anything stand in your way… Watch “Mixing Rock on a Budget Explained®” today! What You Will Learn:\n-Using drum triggers and other enhancements to get great drum sound while still retaining a human feel.\n-Crafting guitar and bass sounds from raw DI tracks.\n-Setting up an effect chain on the mix bus to help glue the tracks together and increase the energy.\n-Using parallel compression on the drums to add vibe and presence.\n-And more!`,

    description: `HiDERA | 06 January 2025 | 1 GB In this in-depth mixing tech house video course, house music guru Larry Holcombe walks you through everything you need to know in order to create an awesome-sounding tech house mix—from the prepping stage all the way through to the final bus processing. You’ll learn invaluable skills like how to use parallel compression, saturation, clipping, sidechaining, and much more. By the end, you’ll be ready to implement your newfound skills to produce a mix you can truly be proud to share. These videos are designed for tech house producers looking to improve their mixes. Larry kicks off the course with an overview of what’s going to be covered, followed by a look at everything involved in prepping the session for mixing. He then sets basic levels for all the tracks based off the kick. Then he shows you how to achieve the all-important pumping effect with sidechain compression and works on shaping some of the transients by adjusting the volume envelopes of certain loops and sounds. Next, you’ll explore the art of subtractive EQ, which is used to help filter out unwanted hum and air so that things stay clean and uncluttered throughout the frequency spectrum. Then Larry shows you how to achieve front-back perspective with compression by adjusting the attack and release times.  Throughout the rest of the course, you’ll learn other techniques as well, such as additive EQ (focusing the midrange to help bring out certain sounds), spatial effects (stereo width, early reflections, reverb, etc.), saturation and parallel compression (for adding hype and excitement), clipping (managing the transients so the bus limiter isn’t pushed too hard), and stereo bus processing (mid/side compression). Whether you’re brand new to mixing tech house music or are simply looking to take your sound to the next level, the skills you’ll learn in this course will help you create effective, impactful tech house mixes that sound punchy and groove hard. See the individual tech house mixing video tutorial descriptions for more information on all the techniques you’ll learn throughout the video course. It’s time to get serious about your process… Watch “Tech House Mixing Explained®” today! What You Will Learn:\n-How to fully prep a session so that it’s ready for mixing and set basic levels based off the kick drum.\n-Using sidechain compression to achieve the trademark pumping effect.\n-Shaping the sound of our mix with subtractive and additive EQ.\n-Adding hype and energy to the mix with saturation and parallel compression.\n-And more!`,

    description: `MORiA | 22 November 2024 | 92.15 MB P440 Sweet Spot You have very likely heard words similar to the following uttered many times about mastering: “it makes the music come to life” or “it is the final polish that transitions into something breathtaking” or “It is like… magic!”. The wizardry lies in the hands of the practitioner of course, but surely, as all wizards wield an unassuming yet infinitely powerful device that is a conduit between their mystical knowledge and the physical world, so does the mastering engineer. To the wizard, it is the magic wand and to the mastering engineer, it is the equalizer.  Forget everything you have been taught about “High Passing” frequencies below 30Hz, and welcome to Sweet Tremor boosting infrasonic frequencies! Attenuate frequencies and you end up with a punchier and open sound! Boost frequencies and end up with sweet cotton candy all over your ears! Scream in horror when you check in Plugin Doctor the low shelf at 200 Hz or the high shelf at 2 kHz with a “stairway to heaven” graph, but then melt in your chair when you listen to it- like candy on a hot summer day. Nothing makes sense …visually but your ears tell you otherwise. P440 Sweet Spot will let you rethink what an EQ can do. P440… your mystical magic wand. Features:\n•  Organic hardware-like feel & behavior.\n•  3 Band EQ combining fixed and proportional Q.\n•  New Tremor circuit.\n•  Custom Shelving curves.\n•  LP & HP filters with resonance.\n•  Zero sample latency!\n•  Dual-mono behavior from within the plugin.\n•  All parameters are exposed to your DAW for automation.\n•  macOS: Silicon ready AU, AAX and VST3 formats.\n•  Windows: VST3 and AAX formats.\n•  Linux LV2 format coming soon! Version 2.0.9 Nov. 21, 2024\n– Proper limiting of the LPF freq. slider depending on your DAW sample rate.\n– P440 code updated for the JUCE 8 framework.\n– P440 plugin (AU, VST3 and AAX) is now placed in a “Pulsar Modular” subfolder instead of a single item directory\n– (Mac users need to delete manually the plugin that is outside the “Pulsar Modular” folder).`,

Packed with innovations, this mixing and mastering plugin is leading the charge into a new age of compressors.  Get the sound of 12 classic compressors\nCenozoix features compression algorithms for all essential elements of production including “Drum,” “Vocal,” “Bus,” and “Mastering,” but also algorithms that recreate the sound of vintage compressors, like “Black FET,” “Blue FET,” “Vintage Opto,” “Virtual-Mu,” and more, delivering the perfect balance of utility and versatility. This compressor plugin can handle all your compression needs, from tight and modern sounds to hefty vintage charm. Apply distortion-free compression to your mixes\nUltra-fast attack and release times can lead to unwanted distortion when using existing compressors. The Cenozoix Compressor utilizes a warp mechanism to avoid these distortion effects, making it a top choice for peak and sidechain compression. Use it to tame harsh snare transients or create basslines that pump alongside your kick. Reduce aliasing with low CPU load using ADAA\nTraditional anti-aliasing methods, which aim to prevent high-frequency distortion, rely on CPU-intensive oversampling. Anti-derivative antialiasing (ADAA) is an audio processing technique developed by Native Instruments, originally used for waveshapers. Instead of depending on oversampling, it leverages advanced mathematics to reduce aliasing without the heavy CPU load. The Cenozoix Compressor is the first compressor plugin to incorporate ADAA. Ensure natural and responsive peak compression\nMany compressors use a static release time, catering to short or long transients but not both. The Cenozoix Compressor’s peak crest function dynamically adjusts the release time based on the nature of the input signal’s transients, ensuring natural and responsive control over dynamic peaks. This makes it a great fit for complex signals running through your vocal, guitar, drum, and stereo bus. Gain nuanced control over your compression envelope\nThe Cenozoix Compressor plugin features a peak detector for quick transient response and an RMS detector for smooth compression. Using these detectors in parallel blends their strengths, providing both an immediate response and consistent compression suitable for complex audio material. You also have the option to leverage pure peak or RMS-based detection, best suited for individual track elements. FEATURES:\n– 12 compression algorithms that recreate the sound of classic compressors\n– 12 compression algorithms for common use cases\n– Distortion-free compression\n– Anti-derivative antialiasing (ADAA)\n– Dual peak and RMS detection\n– Release time that adjusts dynamically\n– Odd and even harmonic generation Changelog Version 1.1.1 (Oct 24, 2024)\nBug Fixes:\n– Fixed a bug where dialog boxes displayed incorrectly in some cases.\n– Fixed a bug where preset names and modification statuses were displayed incorrectly.Optimizations:\n– Added a setting that, when enabled, displays a parameter panel for the selected band in the SideChain EQ, allowing for double-click to enable typing input for editing.\n– Added a status indicator to show when sidechain mode and sidechain EQ are active.\n– Added 3dB, 1dB and 0 dB options for the waveform display’s maximum dB setting.\n– Added -6 dB and -3 dB options for the waveform display’s minimum dB setting.\n– Added the ability to set background images in the theme settings.\n– The ‘alt’ key is now displayed as ‘option’ in the settings on Mac version.`,

    description: `HiDERA | 14 December 2024 | 197 MB Join veteran Groove3 instructor Gary Hiebner for a comprehensive course on producing a song in the Amapiano subgenre. This popular style, which originated in South Africa in the 2010s, combines elements of deep house, jazz, kwaito, and more in a unique and compelling way. You’ll learn about all the conventions and elements commonly found in this style, including instrumentation, arrangement, processing, and mixing ideas. By the end of this Amapiano production course, you’ll be well on your way to creating your first Amapiano hit! Gary starts off with an overview of the Amapiano genre, including its common features and what all will be covered in this course. Then it’s off to the races, and Gary begins by focusing first on programming a kick pattern, designing the kick sound, and adding a hi-hat pattern and a shaker. Then he finishes establishing the core drum track by adding snare, claps, and rimshot, the latter of which features a counter rhythm to generate musical interest.  Next, Gary builds upon this foundation with some auxiliary percussion, including bongos, congas, djembe, and cymbals (and reverse cymbals!). With the percussion out of the way, Gary turns to an electric piano to create the chord progression for the song, along with a layered pad on top. This is followed by some extra synth stabs from Retrologue, which are treated with delay to bounce the synth part around the stereo field. Over the rest of the course, you’ll learn about other elements in the production, including the log drum hook (selecting/processing the sound, creating the melody, etc.), log drum rolls (creating percussive 16th- and 32nd-note rolls for the log drum), electric jazz guitar (sophisticated jazz chords), vocal samples (re-pitching, editing, and processing), arranging the song (choosing which parts to use where to build the song form), and more! This genre is a lot of fun, and the same goes for producing it. By the time you’re through with this Amapiano production course, you’ll have a strong grasp of the integral elements that make up an Amapiano track and the ability to create them in your own productions. See the individual Producing Amapiano video tutorial descriptions for more info on everything that’s covered and how you can use these ideas in your next track. Learn how to craft your next hit… Watch “Producing Amapiano Explained®” now! What You Will Learn:\n-Key elements and sounds found in typical Amapiano track.\n-Selecting appropriate drum samples and programming appropriate patterns.\n-Establishing a chord progression for the song with electric piano and a layered pad.\n-Creating a log drum hook and processing the sound with a layered sub bass, some distortion, and some saturation.\n-And much more!`,

    description: `BOBDULE | 09 October 2024 | 687 MB Cycling ‘74 has released version 8 of Max and the company is calling it “the closest thing to a mind-expanding drug Max has ever had”. The visual programming language has taken on a raft of new improvements in the latest iteration, most notably the introduction of the new MC. objects. MC, we’re presuming, stands for multi-channel and Cycling ‘74 is sure it will “transform how you imagine sound design”. It makes patches with 100 channels of audio look as simple as those with a single channel. It seems MC will give you the ability to manipulate multiple audio channels and operations with fewer objects. Much of the development in version 8 has been focussing on performance. Cycling ’74 now claim that Max will launch 20 times faster on Windows than before and load patches up to four times as quick. Performance as a whole is improved, with complex UI operations being significantly more responsive. Another big update is the ability to control your patches with hardware, without the need to patch. In the new Mappings Mode, you can assign physical controls to your patch in just three steps; simply enter Mappings Mode, select a slider and then move your controller – done.  Other improvements include a new Search Sidebar which allows you access to thousands of Max examples and tutorials that ship with Max, along with results from web forums and in-depth articles. Summary of what’s New in Max 8:\n– Tap into sonic complexity with MC.\n– Noticeably improved performance.\n– Simplified MIDI and keyboard control with Mappings.\n– Vizzie 2, completely rebuilt with OpenGL.\n– Open your patches to the world with Node for Max.\n– Experience a streamlined patching workflow.\n– Uncover the secrets to Max mastery with search.

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 21 November 2024 | 20.2 MB The masters of analog modeling, are back with the plugin of SPL BiG. The 2024 TEC Signal Processing Award-winner, this studio stereo expander won praise from the pros for its huge sound and ingenious design. BiG is fun to use. BiG is distinct. BiG offers new imaginative avenues for sound shaping. Make your mixes sound massive with zero phase issues.  Go BiG or go home\nStereo image enhancement is an important tool for winning the loudness wars and bringing depth and immediacy to tracks. But phase issues have always limited the pros and put off the less experienced. SPL BiG solves these issues and lets you do even more. It processes stereo input with a unique filtering network that prevents phase shifts, cancellations, and unwanted artifacts when summing to mono. Now everyone can benefit from the bigness. Push your stereo image into new dimensions\nSPL BiG is a powerful stereo image processor that offers exceptional control over stereo width and character. Enhance individual tracks by pushing them wider or bringing them to the front of the sonic stage. Add analog tone for fresh, bold mixes. Use it subtly or aggressively to make keyboards, strings, vocals or full mixes as BiG as you need. Depth and bigness with just five controls \nWith its three knobs and two switches, SPL BiG makes radical stereo image enhancement simple, satisfying and free of phase issues. Range Control\nAdjusts the filter frequency for precise control over the processed range. Stage Control\nManipulates the slope and bandwidth. Make key elements of your mix feel more present or push them back to shift focus and create a greater sense of depth. Bigness Control\nBring the “Bigness”. This unique blend knob mixes processed and original audio with SPL’s proprietary combining method, delivering dynamic control over stereo expansion and balance. Simple on the surface but sophisticated at the core\nSPL BiG utilizes a unique stereo processing technique that’s distinct from M/S processing. This is how it enhances your stereo image without introducing phase issues or cancellation to individual tracks, stems and mixes, even when summed to mono. AirBass EQ plus plugin-exclusive features\nSPL BiG also features a bass boost function, using a passive filter inspired by the AirBass circuit in the SPL IRON Mastering Compressor, to enhance your tracks with low-end warmth. The SPL BiG offers plugin-exclusive features including panorama controls, automatic gain compensation, M/S metering, and Mid/Side solo functionality. Features:\n– An exacting model of the 24′ TEC Signal Processing Award-winning hardware, made in cooperation with SPL Audio\n– Expands mixes beyond traditional stereo boundaries.\n– Rich tonal variety with minimal, intuitive controls.\n– Enhances stereo width and bass, add depth and dimension\n– Mono compatibility – Clean mono signal without phase issues when summing the processed stereo signal\n– Intuitive three-button system for shaping width, presence and depth\n– Bass boost filter similar to SPL IRON’s AirBass circuit.\n– Streamlined workflow with ultra low CPU usage`,

    description: `Team SPiRiT | 23 September 2010 | 1.64 GB FORMAT: WAV / ALTIVERB This first Impulse Response (IR) library from Samplicity offers 89 presets from the famous TCE System 6000 hardware reverb in pristine 32 bit quality (24 bit versions are also included). All IRs are available in 48 Khz as well as 44.1 Khz versions, in the Wave file format. For Altiverb 5/6 users there a two folder structures, containing the Wave files with the required folder names and file names.  About True Stereo\nThis library contains True Stereo, or stereo-to-stereo impulse response sets, as well as mono-tostereo impulse files. The True Stereo sets use filenames that end with L and R. Mono-to-stereo files end with C (for Center). This does not apply to the Altiverb files, where we follow the filenaming convention of AudioEase. If you are not certain how to load True Stereo IR sets, please check the documentation of your convolution plugin. True stereo IR sets consist of two stereo IR files, one with reverb information for sound from the left (L) input channel and one for sound from the right (R) input channel. Both files need to be fed with a centered mono signal from respectively the L and R channel. Most current convolution plugins have presets for True Stereo applications. If you use mono-to-stereo IRs it is a good practise to make the input signal mono or nearly mono. Otherwise off-center sounds will have an off-center reverb, which sounds rather odd.For optimal results use the True-Stereo IR sets Why 32 bit?\nThis version of the Samplicity T600 library now also includes all the presets of the famous System 6000 hardware reverb in 32 bit, whereas version 1.0 only provided 24 bit files. The advantage of using 32 bit files is that you get a slightly better quality than when using 24 bit files, since we did all the processing and editing in 32 bit floating point format. Of course we have also created and included 24 bit versions of all presets in case your plugin cannot handle 32 bit files. For optimal results use the 32 bit IR versions\nUsing 32 bit IR-files instead of 24 bit files does not make any difference in CPU-load, as all convolution plugins use 32 bit floating point as their internal processing format. Still, the Samplicity impulse responses are typically long and thus may require more CPU resources than other – free or commercial – IR’s from the System 6000. Note: the Wave files use the 32 bit floating point format (required for the Waves IR-1 plugin).  DiSCONTiNUED: https://mage.si/9Y5X2\n T600 IR Impulse Responses WAV DVDR SCD-SPiRiT\n♪ Download ♪`,

It has a pre-configured signal path that simplifies the mixing process, making it an ideal mixing plugin for musicians with limited mixing experience. The controls are simple and allow you to thicken, tighten, and shape the tone of recordings with minimal effort.  Visualize the tuning of instruments in real time\nThe enhancer’s built-in tuner display makes tuning stringed instruments, analog synths, and percussive elements straightforward. By default, 440 Hz is the tuner’s reference frequency, but you can select any value between 300-500 Hz, including popular alternative tunings like 432 Hz or 415 Hz. enhancer’s tuner can help you notice pitch drift throughout the duration of a performance, making it a critical quality assurance tool. Put a saturator, compressor, EQ, and clipper at your fingertips\nBWX’s enhancer is an all-in-one plugin for mixing individual tracks and groups, integrating the three most essential mixing tools into one package. These include a saturator, compressor, and EQ, each typically applied directly to a track to enhance sound quality. There’s also a built-in clipper capable of harmonic distortion. With reverb and delay set up on aux tracks, enhancer provides all the features necessary to mix a song from start to finish while infusing it with analog vibes. Create wide and controlled mixes\nAdvanced controls include a Mono Maker, Stereo Width knob, Pan control, and Mix parameter. The Mono Maker sums sounds into mono up to 1,500 Hz, ensuring a tighter, clearer low-end with reduced phase issues. By adjusting the Stereo Width knob, you can narrow or widen elements in your mix to fit appropriately within the stereo field. Dialing back the Mix parameter controls the blend between the dry and wet signal, applying all of the plugin’s effects in parallel. Eliminate loudness bias\nThe enhancer’s Auto Level feature addresses the common issue of loudness bias, which can trick your ears into thinking that louder sounds appear subjectively better. This feature matches the plugin’s output level to its input level. By eliminating loudness bias, enhancer helps you make well-informed mixing decisions and achieve the polished results you’re looking for.

Simply add IRDX Core after your guitar amp or IR loader plugin and discover the natural movement, the 3D sensation, the slightly jagged edges, and the unpredictability you could previously only obtain by recording an actual guitar cabinet at high volumes with a microphone. IRDX Core is a unique plugin. It does NOT load impulse responses but instead can be placed after any amp sim or IR loader to add natural sounding speaker dynamics. The kind you can only get by blasting a big speaker cabinet at incredibly high volume. In any major DAW, launch the IRDX Core plugin on an insert slot that immediately follows an IR loader plugin or a guitar amp simulation that includes a model of a speaker cab.  You can use IRDX Core to enhance any such plugin except for the BD ones. That’s because all our amp sim plugins already have the IRDX technology built into them! Any other brand’s IR loader or guitar amp plugin will sound better if it’s followed by IRDX Core.`,

    description: `PDF | 03 January 2025 | 22.97 MB STUDIOMONITORE: Alle Antworten zu Setup und Produkten auf 20 Seiten Das wichtigste Werkzeug zum Beurteilen von Mixen sind – na klar – die Studiomonitore. Doch worauf sollte man bei der Auswahl von Studiomonitoren achten? Warum ist es wichtig, dass diese einen linearen Frequenzgang haben? Und sind 2-Wege- oder 3-Wege-Lautsprecher für das Studiomonitoring die bessere Wahl? Das lösen wir gleich auf! Freue dich auf Antworten zu den häufigsten Fragen zum Thema Studiomonitoren. Plus Marktcheck zu allen aktuellen Aktiven inkl. geeigneten Kopfhörern.  Monitoring-Mythen entlarvt: Hier kommen die Fakten!\nMonitoring ist eigentlich eine einfache Sache: Lautsprecher aufstellen, einmessen, fertig. Die Realität sieht natürlich anders aus. Wer sich etwas mit dem Thema beschäftigt, wird schnell feststellen, dass es recht komplex werden kann. Und im Internet unzählige Mythen darüber kursieren. Daher haben wir Foren durchforstet und ein paar ausgewählte Behauptungen auf den Prüfstand gestellt. Die folgenden zwei Seiten sollen dabei nicht nur unterhaltsam und informativ sein, sondern dir auch als kleines Wiki für die Zukunft dienen. Geschenkt! Zwei Sound-Instrumente von Applied Acoustics: Freie Auswahl aus 76 Packs Ein Software-Highlight, doppelter Spaß: In diesem Monat schenken dir unsere Freunde von Applied Acoustic Systems gleich zwei großartige Sound-Instrumente. Ob du auf Vintage-Synth-Klänge, topmoderne Club-Sounds oder experimentelle Klanglandschaften stehst: Du kannst aus insgesamt 76 Packs deine beiden Favoriten auswählen. Welches Genres oder Stile du auch bevorzugst, hier findest du garantiert die passende Inspiration für deine musikalischen Projekte! Im Studiotest: Roland AIRA Compact P-6\nDer P-6 ergänzt nicht nur die Compact-Serie von Roland perfekt, sondern bietet auch unabhängig davon unglaublich viele Funktionen auf kleinstem Raum. Die kleine Kiste ermöglicht direktes intuitives Sampling und einfache Nachbearbeitung über die kleinen Bedienelemente. In Kombination mit Chopping und Granular-Engine, dem Sequenzer und den Automationsmöglichkeiten sowie den Performance-Effekten sind interessante Pattern schnell und spielerisch erstellt, zumal die Samples sich auch polyphon spielen lassen. Aber hier hört es nicht auf, denn unter der Haube bietet der P-6 eine erstaunlich umfangreiche Detailbearbeitung und viel Spielraum für Experimente. Spätestens hier wird es dann zwar auch recht fummelig aufgrund der kleinen Bedienelemente und des rudimentären Displays, aber die Nutzung der zusätzlichen Funktionen ist ja auch optional. Etwas mehr Speicher für längere Samples hätte Roland dem P-6 aber spendieren können. Lese den ganzen Test in der neusten Ausgabe! Extra nur für Beat-Leser: 24 Advents-Überraschungen\nEs wird Zeit! Zeit für einen anständigen Adventskalender für Producer. Und genau den bekommst du dieses Jahr! Hinter 24 Türchen verstecken sich sensationelle Rabatte Giveaways im Wert von über 3.000 Euro, nur exklusiv für dich als Beat-Leser. Und das Beste: du kannst sogar alle Türchen auf einmal öffnen! Synths, Recorder, Tutorials, Limiter, Soundbänke … es ist von Allem und für alle was dabei. Wir wünschen dir viel Spaß mit den Angeboten! 98 mystische Pads, Glocken & Percussion: Revenge Of The Maya Gods für Zampler & MPCs\nNimm an unserem Klangritual teil und erlebe den magischen Sound einer längst vergangenen Ära. „Revenge Of The Maya Gods“ bringt dir 98 mystische Pads & schillernde Glocken, starke Percussion und traditionelle Instrumente. Diese Klänge atmen die Atmosphäre des tropischen Regenwalds und okkulter Magie und erzeugen sofort ein düsteres und mysteriöses Ambiente. Zeit also, deine Durchschnitts-Synthsounds und -Drums durch diese intensiven Texturen zu ersetzen – ideal für jedes Genre. HAPPY NEW YEAR!`,

The New Epic Toms Ensemble contains over 2.400 samples, built-in articulation browser, internal step-sequencer, front-face FX, textural convolutions and our newest 3.4 Chaos Engine.  Epic Toms Ensemble VST is a large multi-sample library dedicated to massive ensemble percussion. We captured a variety of power articulations, using a combination of high-tuned 10″ – 14″ toms, roto-toms and octabans, various floor toms, bass drums and custom designed mega-toms. Perfect for raging battle scenes or when you just need a really loud boom. We highly recommend trying it with our New Epic Dhol Ensemble, New Epic Frame Drums and Small Epic Percussion. All extensively recorded by some of the very best percussionists* in the world, in a high-ceiling glass, stone and tile hall specifically designed for sample recording. Even though these instruments were all recorded naturally wet for realism and maximum audio quality in our epic recording hall, we have also incorporated advanced programming into every instrument patch that allows you to precisely and realistically shape the decay of the room reverberation with the mod-wheel. This allows custom “room control” shaping, all the way from massive hall down to small drum room.`,

Trivium lead\nThe Trivium Ampknob Lead is much more than just an amplifier model. It also includes a chorus/doubler effect we call Chorey, and a delay — essential effects for great Trivium lead tones. To top it off, the effects can be used in stereo for wide, attention-grabbing sounds. Trivium bass\nThe Trivium Bassknob has been designed to deliver just that. Use a bass with bright, clean bass strings and clear pickups, run it through the Trivium Bassknob plugin, and you’ll find yourself nailing Paolo’s signature tone in seconds.

Tunes featuring everything from bursting brass sections, to sultry muted horn and subdued piano grooves will have you speaking Spanish in no time. The rhythm en clave rolls and bounces, the bass dances back and forth, the brass struts and cheers. The 26 kits in this library have enough variation and personality to make your production feel like Tito, Paquito and Chucho are in your studio; Peter Escovedo has pulled together signature Latin sounds that can be used in salsa, rumba, songo, mambo, cha-cha, bolero, samba, and bossa nova.  Latin Jazz 2 has been formatted in the most widely-used formats: Apple Loops, Acidized WAV and REX files, making it usable in virtually every piece of software and hardware in use on the market today. In addition this library comes fully formatted for Kontakt as part of the Big Fish Audio KLI 3.0 Series which transforms this loop library into a truly moldable and musical writing instrument. Latin Jazz 2 has been formatted in all the industry standard file types: Apple Loops, Acidized WAV and REX. Every piece of commonly used hardware and software will be compatible with at least one of these fully developed and usable formats. Each audio file has been expertly cut and edited to loop perfectly and has been recoded in the highest quality 24-bit rate to ensure absolutely top quality end results. If you work primarily with Apple Products be sure to utilize the extra loop tagging functionality in Garageband and Apple Logic as well as Apple’s proprietary time stretching and pitch bending algorithms. If you’re working inside Protools, Cubase, Fruity Loops, Ableton Live, Sony ACID or any other DAW on the market, the Acidized WAV files are the perfect fit for time stretching and pitch bending capabilities. The Acidized WAV files can also be used as standard wav files in almost any music tool in production today. Beat-makers and artists who love sampled melodic slices work well with our REX/RMX format that takes advantage of all the powerful programming found in Stylus RMX and the Dr. Octo REX player in Propellerheads Reason DAW.

But modern features like a greatly expanded modulation matrix and additional modulation sources—such as three envelopes and four LFOs per voice—take it way beyond vintage gear and make it a worthy and unique addition to the Prophet family tree. Features include a gated 16 x 4 step sequencer, arpeggiator, split or stacked key modes with separate stereo outputs per layer, and rack ears for optional rack-mounting. The Prophet ’08 module can also be used as an expander to increase the polyphony of another Prophet ’08—keyboard or module—to 16 voices.  The Prophet ’08 PE (potentiometer edition) has all the features of the standard Prophet ’08, but many of the front panel’s rotary controls use potentiometers (AKA “pots”) for more “vintage-style” control. (The standard Prophet ’08 primarily uses rotary encoders.) Full-featured polysynth with a 100% analog signal path. Classic, real analog sound—including legendary Curtis analog low-pass filters—married to a modern feature set. Compact size, huge sound. Tons of knobs for direct, real-time editing and performance.

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 02 January 2025 | 25 MB PITCHSHIFT is the ultimate pitch-shifting plug-in for music production, sound design and post production. It combines multiple high-quality pitch algorithms, ranging from the classic delay-line design to advanced resynthesis, time-stretching, and state-of-the-art hybrid processing. The plug-in comes in two tiers: the three-algorithm PITCHSHIFT for mono and stereo duties, and the six-algorithm PITCHSHIFT PRO, which adds more sound design options and supports up to 16 channels of phase-synchronous multi-channel processing for immersive workflows.  Whether you’re adding a fifth or octave to a guitar or vocal, adjusting the pitch of a loop to fit your project, making monster voices and alien machinery, or adjusting the pitch of a film mix for frame rate conversion, PITCHSHIFT delivers maximum quality with minimum effort! Version 1.2.0:\n* New MIDI note control of PITCH, PITCH SHIFT and FORMANTS, including adjustable pitch bend amount up to +-12 semitones: you can now control these key parameters by sending MIDI notes to the plug-in, making for a quick way to find suitable settings as well as musical interaction with the processing. The pitch range of Type A, B, C, D and E is extended significantly when controlled via MIDI notes. Caution: very fun!\n* New GLIDE parameter: up to 10 seconds of GLIDE can be applied both to MIDI note control of parameters as well as to the UI knobs for them. Various GLIDE shapes are provided.\n* New Enhanced III and Enhanced IV Window modes for Type A: two new enhanced versions of the Hann and Multi-Res windows, with even more focus on transient reproduction.\nImproved numerical entry of wet filter frequency: You can now set the frequency in Hertz, and differentiate between lowpass and highpass using a prefix; “LP” or “-” (minus) plus a frequency in Hertz results in a lowpass, “HP” or “+” plus a frequency results in a highpass filter.\n* Fixed an issue where writing automation using the PITCH SHIFT trackball would cause * FORMANTS to be written and selected in the DAW if LINK is on.\n* Fixed an issue that could cause zipper noise when changing wet filter frequency.\n* Updated manual to include all new features released since v1.0.0.`,

The DM Pro Expandable 20 Bit Drum Module is the most advanced electronic drum and percussion device available today. It surpasses the capabilities of what you expect in a drum module by offering features like 64 voice polyphony, a massive drum and percussion library that includes over 1,000 sounds, and open-ended expandability that lets you bring in new sounds whenever you need them. For composers who need a dedicated MIDI module for drums, or drummers looking for the professional solution for triggered electronic drum performances, the DM Pro represents the most powerful tool for creative inspiration. Designed to accommodate nearly any musical style, the DM Pro offers 1,024 different kick, snare, tom, cymbal, hi-hat, percussion and special effect samples. You can create and store up to 32 virtual drumkits, and each kit can contain up to 64 different drum sounds so the right drum is always available when you need it. The DM Pro has 16 fast trigger inputs for drummers using electronic pads or triggered acoustic drums, and provides six independent audio outputs so that processing of levels and effects for discrete sounds is easier than on any other Alesis drum device. Plus, the DM Pro’s customizable onboard multieffects use the same processing engine as our top-of-the-line multieffects device, the Q20. Its expansion slot lets you pull in new sounds anytime you need them. Since the PCMCIA-format cards store up to 8MB of memory, you can simultaneously access a massive collection of 24MB of sounds. Plus, the DM Pro is compatible with Alesis’ Sound Bridge sample management software, so you can burn your own sounds and samples to a card for customized sounds. Also, the DM Pro’s stereo audio inputs on RCA connectors allow external audio sources, like CD Players or tape decks, to be routed through an audio system so drummers can practice along with recorded music.

    description: `Team HCiSO | 02 January 2024 | 302.60 MB (AU, VSTi, STANDALONE, 64Bit) MASSIVE is a sonic monster – the ultimate synth for basses and leads. The analog concept belies the contemporary, cutting-edge sound it generates. The high-end engine delivers pure quality, lending an undeniable virtue and character to even the most saturated of sounds. The interface is clearly laid out and easy to use, ensuring you will have MASSIVE generating earth-shuddering sounds from the very first note. The synth that defined bass music, this powerhouse synthesizer is an uncompromising sonic monster and the go-to choice for bass music and electro producers. MASSIVE gives your tracks a solid foundation with the creamiest, punchiest basses. Razor-sharp leads cut through the mix even with grit and dirt piled high. And an overwhelming array of wavetable oscillators, modulation options, and filters, and effects offer a sonic spectrum as broad as it is inspiring. MASSIVE contains over 1300 sounds, all crafted by leading artists and sound designers. The efficient search and intuitive filter functions let you find presets according to specific characteristics and attributes – a particularly musical and intuitive approach.  MACRO CONTROLS\nMASSIVE’s macro controls offer fast, direct control – automatically mapped to the eight macro knobs on all Komplete Kontrol S-Series keyboards, and all Maschine hardware. All of a sound’s most important parameters are pre-configured and mapped to these controllers. A single controller can handle multiple assignments – for example, just twist ‘Rhythm’ and watch how multiple underlying parameters change simultaneously. The macro controls enable you to customize any of MASSIVE’s presets instantly and profoundly, without having to understand the technical structure of the sound. The macro controls essentially turn each sound into a set of possible sounds that seamlessly morph into one another. Moreover, the macro controls are the most important interface to other applications. They are targets for MIDI assignments, which are easily set using the MIDI Learn function. They are also the first eight parameters that are reported to any host when MASSIVE is used as a plug-in. SOUND SYNTHESIS\nMASSIVE’s sound synthesis is based on a unique Wave Scanning algorithm, implemented in three parallel oscillator modules. It combines the highest sonic quality with utmost flexibility and controllability. Think of a Wave Scanning oscillator as a multi-track sequencer; one of the tracks contains a saw wave and the other a pulse wave. In the vertical dimension, each of MASSIVE’s oscillators allows these tracks to be faded seamlessly into one another. In the horizontal dimension, a single cycle’s read-out speed curve can be manipulated in three different bending modes. MASSIVE features an unlimited number of these “tracks” in each wavetable as well as two additional manipulation modes relevant for time and frequency settings. Of course, the “tracks” are not restricted to usual sawtooth or pulse waves. MASSIVE comes with 85 specially designed wavetables, each one with a unique combination of waveforms and particular sonic characteristics. Finally, a modulation oscillator can be used to vary the main oscillators’ signal. It can be used for ring modulation, phase modulation (which sounds similar to FM) as well as further modulation modes. A noise generator provides an additional signal source that can be mixed in with the other signals, generating particular effects. It can, for instance, be used in combination with MASSIVE’s comb filters for a physical modelling approach to sound design. FLEXIBLE ROUTING\nMASSIVE’s basic structure conforms to the well-known subtractive synthesis paradigm, making it easy to understand while simultaneously ensuring the signal flow is highly flexible. You can place two insert effects at various places within the signal flow. You can also take the signal at any point and route it back to the beginning. For example, you can filter a sound and feed it back into the filter’s input. This can create very lively and dynamic results. The flexibility is further increased by placing an insert effect into the feedback path. You can route any of the oscillator’s signals directly to the synthesizer’s output, bypassing all filters and/or master effects. This feature allows a direct ‘punch’ to be added to layered, highly modulated sounds, for example, to add a sub-bass. MODULATION SOURCES\nMASSIVE features several types of modulation sources that, thanks to the innovative user interface, can easily be assigned to any of its parameters. Multiple parameters can be assigned to a single macro control, bundling technical settings into a single control – a far more musical approach. For instance, you can assign both the filters’ cutoff frequencies to one macro control and label it as “Brightness”. The envelopes in MASSIVE feature an advanced loop mode: a part of the envelope can be looped and you can morph between different transitions or crossfades for the defined loop start and end points. Various other options make MASSIVE’s envelopes truly unique. MASSIVE contains two step sequencer modes: While the Stepper conforms to the well-known, established operating modes, the Performer allows each step to be shaped individually, making it ideal for advanced rhythmic structures. A flexible low frequency oscillator completes the list of modulation sources. The variety of possibilities is as wide as it is fast to use. This is further enhanced by the inclusion of templates for standard tasks for all the modulation sources, such as envelopes, LFOs, steppers and performers. For example, setting an envelope to a generic ADSR shape is a quick, one-click issue. CHANGE THE FRAMEWORK\nMASSIVE’s various global settings pages allow a variety of parameters to be adjusted – parameters that most other synthesizers leave unmentioned and unadjustable. MASSIVE unveils their true sound design potential. The Keytracking pages map the incoming pitch information generated by your keyboard or sequencer individually for each oscillator and filter. There is even separate keytracking control over the filters’ cut-off frequencies and other additional parameters such as a bandpass filter’s width or a comb filter’s feedback. This allows effects to be created that can be controlled by simply playing your keyboard. Like in most synthesizers, you can adjust glide times between pitches when you play legato notes. MASSIVE goes a step further, allowing the pitchbend range or the phase of each oscillator to be adjusted. The Voicing page allows switching between polyphonic and monophonic voice handling as well as several voice trigger options, for example playing musical-sounding trills easily with your keyboard. Several voices can be triggered by a single note. Much like an orchestra where several violins play the same ‘voice’, making the sound warmer and more lively, the unisono feature makes your sound thick and vivid. This feature can also be adjusted to extreme settings, spreading your voices over several octaves or filling the stereo panorama – all with just one single note being played. THE LIBRARY\nMASSIVE contains over 1300 production-ready sounds, including the full libraries from former products ‘MASSIVE Expansion’ 1 and 2, ‘Urban Arsenal’ 1 and 2, and ‘MASSIVE Threat’. All have pre-defined macro controls and all have been crafted by professional sound designers and well-known artists. The spectrum of styles included is as wide and varied as music itself, bound to inspire you no matter what the flavour of the piece you’re currently working on. The browser, besides being intuitive and easy to handle, delivers results in an instant. MASSIVE Expansions\nMASSIVE Expansions are a new line of tailor-made presets exclusively designed for Native Instruments MASSIVE. Each comes loaded with 150 customizable presets – giving you the ingredients you need to instantly bring your ideas to life.

    description: `Team ViP | 02 January 2024 | 17.07GB …: HAPPY NEW YEAR :… Seven years have passed since we released the incredibly popular KABUKI & NOH PERCUSSION library. Over this time, we have gradually upgraded and expanded our large collection of recordings and samples of percussion instruments featured in Kabuki and Noh theater. We are now finally releasing this work as a massive upgrade entitled KABUKI & NOH PERCUSSION 96k MASTER EDITION — a Kontakt library with full-on professional specs and Sonica Instrument’s unparalleled quality. KABUKI & NOH PERCUSSION 96k MASTER EDITION puts the sounds of Japan in the hands of all music creators.  Main Features​:\n– Contains 65 types of percussion instruments — virtually every percussion instrument known in Kabuki and Noh theater — in 96 kHz / 24-bit high resolution.\n– Each instrument has been recorded in a rich multi-mic setting, with Direct 1, Direct 2, Overhead, Room, and Stereo Mix channels available (the sample data is equivalent to about 40 GB in WAV format or about 20 GB in NCW format).\n– Features two newly-recorded bonus libraries: a library of hayashi ensemble kakegoe calls and a library of Nohkan flute phrases.\n– Individually recorded left-hand and right-hand hits are sampled alternately with up to 100 velocity layers to create extremely realistic dynamics and roll expressions.\n– 20 preset kits, each with a carefully selected assortment of instruments loaded in 16 instrument slots.\n– 144 authentic hayashi percussion grooves (MIDI patterns).\n– The built-in Instrument Editor gives full control over tuning and tone without any loss in sound quality or instrument timbre.\n– The Instrument Mixer lets you create your own fine mixes for individual instruments.\n– Includes impulse responses from a Noh theater renowned among Noh musicians for its acoustics.\n– NKS ready and Kontakt Player compatible. 96 kHz / 24-bit high-fidelity samples Rich, high-resolution samples of virtually every percussion instrument known to Kabuki and Noh theater The original KABUKI & NOH PERCUSSION (BFD format) software library covered many Kabuki and Noh theater percussion instruments. Over the seven years since its release, we have made fresh, powerful recordings with even higher sound quality of the Nohkan flute, kakegoe calls, and ashibyoushi foot stomps on a Noh stage. KABUKI & NOH PERCUSSION 96k MASTER EDITION contains over 60 instruments with uncompromising specs — 96 kHz / 24-bit high resolution with multiple mic channels — for an even larger audience of music creators. Vivid natural dynamics and the inherent expressive force of Japanese instruments\nSeparately recorded left-hand and right-hand hits are sampled alternately with up to 100 velocity layers for very natural-sounding dynamics and roll expressions. The kotsuzumi is best known for its distinctive pon sound, but the instrument in fact harbors a rich palette of expressions. In addition to providing the crisp pon, pu, chi, ta, and pe percussive taps, the library lets you use a velocity controller for full control over nuanced portamento slides that are created by squeezing and releasing the drum’s cords. Taking the shimedaiko for example, we captured left-hand and right-hand hits separately. But we also included all key articulations native to the shimedaiko, such as the tsuke effect, where bachi sticks strike and then rest on the drum head. A wealth of rare instruments\nThe collection contains many rare instruments, such as the ekiro (a doughnut-shaped horse bell), orgol (a music box), matsumushi (a small flat gong), fusegane (an altar gong), hontsurigane (a large bell), and other Kabuki sound effects. The odaiko can express the wind, snow, water, and other natural elements as well as the inner thoughts and feelings of actors on stage. It can even imitate the spookiness of a ghost’s entrance. The Master Edition features odaiko articulations played with nagabachi (long, tapered sticks for sound effects) and yukibai (a special stick to imitate the sound of snow), giving music producers the scope to recreate every nuance of the odaiko in Kabuki. 20 preset kits, each with a carefully selected assortment of instruments loaded in 16 slots\nKABUKI & NOH PERCUSSION 96k MASTER EDITION has 16 instrument slots. The preset kits let you quickly load instruments in the slots for specific musical contexts. For example, you can load a kit with instruments specifically for the Kabuki stage, a kit with instruments specifically for the Noh stage, or a kit with Kabuki sound effects. Naturally, you can edit any preset kit and arrange instruments to your liking. Two newly-recorded bonus libraries of kakegoe calls and Nohkan flute phrases\n– We extended the library’s content to be the definitive library of hayashi ensemble sounds.\n– Voices of Kabuki & Noh contains a wide collection of real hayashi kakegoe calls, while Nohkan Flute is packed with quintessential Nohkan phrases.\n– All samples in both libraries have been newly recorded for this release, so you can build the most complete hayashi ensemble possible. Instrument Editor gives full control over tuning and tone of each instrument\nThe Instrument Editor’s controls let you precisely adjust the tone of each instrument without affecting the sonic quality of the percussive attack transients. For example, you can re-pitch the instrument or adjust the strength of the attack transient. This gives you the ability to endlessly modify instrument colors to your liking, with no loss in the rich high-resolution sound quality. Individual instrument mixers\nThe Instrument Mixer provides fine adjustments of the five microphone channels — Direct 1, Direct 2, Overhead, Room, and Stereo Mix —for each instrument. The mixer gives you full freedom over the mix balance to suit any situation. You can also insert compression and EQ on the instrument’s master mix bus. The library contains impulse responses from a Noh theater renowned among Noh musicians for its acoustics. The impulse responses are used with the built-in convolution reverb function. There are two responses: one from the stage and one from the audience seats. MIDI Groove Browser​\n– KABUKI & NOH PERCUSSION 96k MASTER EDITION features the incredibly useful Groove Browser, that lets you quickly find MIDI grooves and drag & drop grooves directly into your DAW.\n– You can adjust the grooves’ velocity, swing, playback tempo, and other parameters directly from KONTAKT / KOMPLETE KONTROL.\n– The library comes packed with exclusive hayashi ensemble grooves (MIDI patterns) often heard in Kabuki.\n– When combined with the soon-to-be-released Groove Inspirations MIDI pack, the Groove Browser gives you access to an extensive phrase bank. NKS & Native Access ready\nKABUKI & NOH PERCUSSION 96k MASTER EDITION is NKS compatible so it can be used with Kontakt Player, Kontakt Full (Ver. 6.6 or newer), and Komplete Kontrol. When KABUKI & NOH PERCUSSION 96k MASTER EDITION is linked with a Komplete Kontrol keyboard or other NKS-compatible hardware, you can quickly preview tones and make full use of the hardware’s knobs and controllers.   Works with NI Kontakt Player v6.6 and higher!`,

Faithful modeling of a unique design\nIn collaboration with Spectra 1964, we gained access to William G. Dilley’s original, detailed schematics and personal notes to create the most faithful model of this incredible design.`,

    description: `P2P | 16 May 2019 | 8.6 GB WAV | 24-bit / 96 kHz CINEMATIC FIRE & WATER WITH AN INCREDIBLY STRONG CHARACTER Fire & Water are two very impressive and interesting elements. Their manifestations range from tiny and harmless to huge and devastating. As a consequence their sonic character is just as diverse and should be properly featured with all its facets in a sound FX library. And that was just our minimum requirement for this masterpiece. Besides several thousand (!) of fire & water sounds, we added a lot of extraordinary sweeteners to further support the already strong character and to give your sound design this specific edge. As this library carries the „Cinematic“ label, it is destined to once more raise the bar in terms of characteristic and state-of-the-art sound FX. The outcome is a stunning collection of sounds that’s packed up to the lid with extraordinary sound design compositions and a huge amount of crystal-clear source recordings. You’ll love the crispiness, the punch, the tremendous power, the fine details and the versatile spectrum of sounds.  FIRE & WATER CONSTRUCTION KIT THE SOURCE RECORDINGS TO FUEL YOUR OWN CREATIVE DESIGNS\nPacked with over 2,300 absolutely clean, well-selected source recordings, the CONSTRUCTION KIT equips you to sculpt authentic and powerful sounds for your hot & wet projects, featuring virtually any movement, size, intensity, duration, state or sonic color. From small sizzling and steady flowing over bubbling and submersion effects to aggressive and devastating blasts, crashes and whooshes, this library delivers an enormous pool of content that not only provides all the essential sound design components, but also raises the bar once more in terms of recording techniques and resulting quality. SWEETENERS – THE SECRET WEAPON FOR UNIQUE SOUND DESIGN\nYou’re going to love those as they will enhance your designs and give them an unrivalled and instant presence in the mix. Have you ever heard this question: „What’s that one sound? I can’t tell exactly what is is but it sounds awesome.“ Well, that’s what sweeteners are for. They can really make the difference between regular sound design and detail-rich sound design. FIRE & WATER DESIGNED READY-TO-USE SOUNDS FOR INSTANT AWESOMENESS\nUnleash the fullness of nature’s fury with the fierce DESIGNED collection. This is where the incredibly detailed recordings of the CONSTRUCTION KIT take on a life of their own with earth-shaking force and impact. Most sounds are available as small, medium and large variants – all fully immersive and production ready: You can’t help but picture an epic scene for each with your eyes closed. PERFECT TO BEEF UP TRAILERS AND MORE\nBesides the obvious field of application which is designing fire & water sounds, this pack really shines when it comes to designing some out-of-this-world trailers. Or what about applying fire & water sounds to creatures, to destruction scenarios, to heavy impacts? This is all up to you. WHAT WE RECORDED\nOur sound designers have spared no effort nor expense to set a new standard in cinematic sound design – two microphones took a hefty scorching in the process. We also went underwater, equipped with wetsuits and hydrophones to cover every possible angle. Pouring water from dazzling heights, smashing oversized water bombs and experimenting with combusting chemicals and flamethrowers was also part of the fun. WHAT’S SO SPECIAL ABOUT THIS LIBRARY?\nOccasionally a team with decades of experience manages to surprise itself with how much more is yet possible and can be achieved with combined effort – this library marks one of those moments. FIRE & WATER takes our own standard a notch higher and we are confident in presenting it as a meaningful contribution to the audio industry. COMPATIBLE SOFTWARE\nsound FX come as WAV files, meaning you can import and work with them in any software that can handle this file type. Here are the most common audio and video editing software tools that work perfectly with our sound FX. RICH METADATA EMBEDDED\nTo provide you with the fastest and easiest workflow possible, all files contain extensive metadata like file description & keywords to quickly find the sounds you’re looking for. Metadata can be read and processed by audio management tools. Some digital audio workstations feature an included search tool that can also read embedded metadata.`,

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 10 December 2024 | 8.2MB PLATFORMS: STANDALONE/VSTi/VST3 Syne is a fully modular additive synthesizer with a beautiful analog sound and extreme flexibility. Introducing Syne, the most powerful and flexible modular additive synthesizer. Syne is a new, fully modular additive synthesizer capable of rendering more than 20000 partials on a recent CPU (=powerful) while having full control over each partial (=flexible). This allows making complex sounds that are not possible with other types of synthesis.  Features:\n– Additive synth engine that allows complex sounds and/or high polyphony.\n– Fully modular architecture with more than 30 modules.\n– Clean sound, no need to use an aliasing filter or other hacks.\n– Detailed UI when zooming.\n– Wavetable file import. The wavetables are not just spectral interpolated, but kept in the spectral domain all the time during synthesis.\n– Wavetable generation for a single click.\n– All parameters can be automated.\n– No internet connection is required for activation or operation.​​​​​​​. Cleanest possible analog sound\nThere is only one thing better than having a good antialiasing filter: when you don’t need one. Additive synthesis is trivially bandlimited simply by not generating harmonics higher than half the sampling rate. Syne provides the cleanest sound possible, suitable for electronic music. Extreme flexibility\nCreate any moving filters that you’d like without limitations of the PCM filter design! Assign any MIDI CC’s, time or automation to any parameters. Set up LFO rate and depth as a function of frequency, so that each partial has its own setting. Use different decay for each partial. Almost anything is possible. Wavetable import\nThe wavetables are not just spectral interpolated, but kept in the spectral domain all the time during synthesis. Generate a random wavetable for a single click in the Wave Morpher. In Syne you can use non-harmonic partials in wavetables which is not possible in a wavetable synthesizer. 30+ modules included\nAll the modules work on hundreds or thousands of sinusoidal oscillators. This is very different from PCM modular synthesis because it allows effects that are not possible with a PCM signal. Make great sounds with just 3-4 modules! Combine simple waveforms together to create complex sounds. Modules can store presets that you can recall anytime. Preset generation\nPreset generation and mutation\nIt is possible to generate new presets or mutate existing presets by a percentage, with many options. Simple user interface\nWe made the UI as simple as possible. Instead of having hundreds of knobs and junctions for a usual modular synth, using Syne is simple and straightforward. Zooming in is smooth and will show more details. Font size and all colors of the UI are adjustable. Small and efficient\nAdditive synthesis is very processor intensive. Calculating each sound sample requires summing hundreds or thousands of oscillators depending on the sound complexity and polyphony. We developed a highly efficient engine capable of rendering 15000 partials on an older processor that supports SSE3, and well over 20000 on a newer processor with AVX2 support.

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 10 December 2024 | 26.1MB PLATFORM: STANDALONE/VST3/AAX(MOD) New technologies, for better results in less time. Thanks to the fundamentally improved “Melodic” algorithm, Melodyne makes your vocal editing even better than before. With perfect, natural corrections at the press of a key. Thanks to the Chord Track, you can adapt notes with lightning speed to suit the song – chord recognition included. And with the unique Fade Tool, you can create note-based fades – even in polyphonic recordings and samples.  All this is new:\n– the ability to edit pitched and noise-like components separately with the “Melodic” algorithm\n– a more musical analysis of pitch deviations\n– the Chord Track and Chord Grid for pitch editing, chord recognition\n– the Fade Tool and Leveling Macro for editing dynamics\n– an additional algorithm (“Percussive Pitched”) plus other algorithm improvements\n– search functions for keyboard shortcuts, saving of shortcut sets Changelog 5.4.2:\nNew in Version 5.4.2\nThe free update to Melodyne 5.4.2 features optimizations and bug fixes as well as important adaptations to macOS Sequoia. We recommend it to all users.\n– macOS Sequoia: Previously, the function “Private Wi-Fi Address” made it necessary to reactivate Melodyne. With Melodyne 5.4.2, the function can be used free from any such inconvenience.\n– macOS in general: Scrolling with the trackpad has been revised and improved.\n– macOS in general: Changing to another program sometimes gave rise to graphic artifacts.\n– ARA and plug-in: Under certain circumstances, opening Melodyne could lead to a crash.`,

It features three unique kits, a wealth of snare drums and kicks as well as over 30 cymbals – all flawlessly captured in one of the world’s most famed studios for hard rock and metal: Studio A at One On One in Los Angeles. Massive-sounding, warm and vibrant but at the same time just as tight and aggressive, this room has all the qualities to move air in a way that makes it seem custom-built particularly for hard-hitting metal drums. This goes to show on the plethora of defining records that were recorded here, some of which include the likes of Megadeth’s “Rust in Peace,” Metallica’s “…And Justice for All” and “Black Album,” Dream Theater’s “Awake” and Testament’s “The Ritual.” Each of the three drum kits included represents its own niched sound. One covers Dirk’s current touring setup, one is from his tenure in the band Soilwork and one was handpicked to offer a completely contrasting tone and vibe. All in all, you’ll have a balanced but eclectic palette of kits encompassing anything from the loud, aggressive and punchy to the big, low and warm.  In addition to the sounds, a wealth of mix-ready presets as well as a collection of drum grooves and fills are provided, allowing you to instantly get going producing drum parts that perfectly pair Dirk’s patented brand of drumming madness with Rakestraw’s crystal-clear engineering. Setting out to deliver the archetype of an EZX to muster any imaginable facet of heaviness – from the coarse onslaught of old-school thrash and massively pummeling modern metal to the expressive, fusion-like and progressive – the team outstripped every expectation. This is an expansion that checks all the boxes for drummer, engineer, room, gear and sound. Simply put, this EZX is nothing short of sheer and absolute metal perfection.  Added Missing 14 Part`,

Control the low-end Tightness of a kick drum, add or remove midrange Body from a snare, or tune the high-frequency Presence of a drum mix. Gain\nTransient shaping can add a lot of volume to your signal. Use the Output Gain to counter this, so you can better compare processed and unprocessed with the Bypass button. You can also use Gain to drive the Soft Clip circuit for some extra “crack”! Soft clip\nThis “speaker protection” circuit both clips the output level at “0” (unity gain) and adds mild coloration/distortion – even on lower signals. Bypass\nGreat for on/off testing. Bypass is also available in your host, but using that may cause audible glitches due to latency compensation kicking in and out. DS-10’s Bypass syncs both on and off.

Colossal in anything from size and musical scope, the grand piano is the unequivocal centerpiece in any orchestral setting. With its limitless expression – resonant, wild and untamed while ever-so articulate – it can take on any thinkable musical scenario, from the roaringly loud to the velvety frail. In this EKX expansion for EZkeys 2, we’ve taken arguably the grand piano of grand pianos and, to add, placed it in one of the most flawlessly crafted studio rooms ever built and utilized the absolute best the world has to offer in terms of recording technology to capture it. The result is an immaculate grand, breathtakingly epic in any and all respects imaginable.  The instrument in question is a Steinway* D-274, one of the world’s most heralded instruments of its kind and a top pick for concert halls around the world. Measuring 274 centimeters in length, this majestic and one-of-a-kind colossus is a marvel of engineering and craftsmanship involving 12,000 individual parts assembled with utmost detail. To capture it, where better to turn than the main hall at Galaxy Studios – the very room in which the core library for Superior Drummer 3 and several other Toontrack libraries were recorded. Boasting 330 square meters and a daunting floor-to-ceiling height, it has an ambience tailored for natural but controlled reverberation. To offer flexible use in anything from the full-scale and orchestral down to the intimate and scaled-down, the recording setup included an array of 19 individual microphones. In the final product, these mics are used to give you mix-ready presets showcasing the instrument in a wealth of different mic configurations and timbres. In addition to the sounds and the presets, a basic collection of MIDI unique to the product and tailored for the instrument is included.`,

Use the Fine control for pushing / dragging micro-timings or modulate your delay lines like never before.\n– Filter: Nested within the feedback path, switchable lowpass, highpass, and bandpass filters empower you to beautifully sculpt your echos. Easily add modulation for unique dynamic movement and depth.\n– Feedback: Define the intensity in conventional percent or our modern dB/s approach. Use crossfeed for classic ping pong delay style effects. Increase the intensity by using the over-feedback mode to build up your echos beyond infinity.`,

Because the w495 has wide equalization curves that can be pushed to ridiculous levels while remaining musical. The w495 is an easy-to-use tone shaper for individual tracks.

    description: `P2P | 08 December 2024 | 2.43 GB Capturing the raw essence of how drums sound when recorded using a minimal vintage-meets-modern setup in a cramped basement studio, this expansion for EZdrummer 3 and Superior Drummer 3 presents arguably the most unpolished, gritty and tangible kits you’ll ever hear. Inspired by punk, hardcore, metal, indie, psychedelic rock, kraut and all peripheral offshoots of the underground scenes of the early ’90s until today, this is an eclectic collection of drums that sounds as far from the beaten path you possibly can imagine. If you’re looking for an EZX that is loud, decadent, angry and all-around fuming of unpretentious, nonchalant in-your-face energy, this one’s for you. The Underground EZX was recorded by Refused drummer David Sandström and engineer/producer/mixer Martin “Konie” Ehrencrona at the famed Studio Cobra – a small, low-ceiling basement studio in the heart of Stockholm, Sweden. From this dungeon-like place – brimming with tape machines, old tube gear and vintage instruments – Konie has been churning out productions bursting with his signature stripe of analog character for the likes of Refused and Tribulation, to name a few. With a collection of David’s own drums, the studio’s and those of bands and friends on the Stockholm scene, they made sure this EZX had four distinctly unique kits, each bringing its niched sound and vibe to the project. Expect a broad palette of scarred, road worn and tried-and-true kits all put through the paces on anything from big festival stages and underground club stages to a wealth of albums of all styles.  In addition to the kits, a selection of mix-ready presets for each of the four kits is provided. Engineered by Konie, it covers anything from the absolutely bare and raw to the distorted, all-out menacing and wild. To add, a basic collection of grooves and fills performed by David is included, giving you a foundation of his unapologetic and hard-hitting style of drumming to build from. This is an EZX in which you can almost hear the vintage tube gear radiate, the hiss breathe and every wayward and unrelenting drum hit propel in a way that makes the kits want to climb out of the monitors. Whether you’re looking to write a post-punk track teeming with lo-fi DYI feels or any stripe of savage, distorted and organic-sounding kraut, metal, hardcore or garage rock, this is your new go-to EZX. Want grit? This is the very definition of it.`,

One is the exceptional compression transparency that this kind of compressor can achieve, even when pushed into extreme gain reduction. Another – and perhaps the most common – is their ability to add cohesion or “glue” to buses, whole mixes and masters. Unfortunately, the original hardware is expensive and difficult to integrate with “in-the-box” workflows.`,

Persevering musicians devote their lives to the search of perfection in playing and further understanding of a music that is as Spiritual as it is Complex and as Magical as it is Puzzling. This exotic and almost inebriating energy that exhales from Indian Music easily blends itself with other genres conferring an always alluring and colorful tone to a track. However it is extremely difficult for many music producers to access such sounds without spending a fortune and in some cases without having to travel to India.. Our mission was therefore to develop a collection of Indian Music that finally brings music producers thousands & thousands of samples at the best possible price !  With this in mind Future Loops travelled to this fascinating country and recorded ” Total India “, a massive collection of 44 instruments ( plus Vocals ) , that reflects the intoxicating splendor of Indian Music.

    description: `P2P | 08 December 2024 | 7.84 GB When it comes to heavy rock, nothing is as fundamental as an unwavering wall of hard-hitting drums steamrolling like a freight train at the forefront of the mix. If you’re looking for stalwart-type sounds that you can trust to hold down the rhythm section in any mix scenario of that kind you may find yourself in, this is an EZX for you. Recorded by acclaimed mixer/engineer/producer Jay Ruston (Stone Sour, Anthrax, The Donnas) and sampled by drummer Jeff Friedl (A Perfect Circle, Devo, Filter), this expansion for EZdrummer 3 and Superior Drummer 3 combines two rock heavyweights and delivers exactly what its title promises: drums specifically tailored for heavy rock productions. In total, it includes four unique kits, one extra recorded kit configuration as well as several additional snares – all handpicked to ensure a width of tones that ranges from the rich, dark and boomy to the ringy, tight and snappy. To add, the kits were captured at a private high-end studio in the Los Angeles area boasting a massive-sounding but still not overpowering room, making it the perfect choice for loud rock drums that sound thunderously big but not drowned out by excessive ambience.  In addition to the sounds, a broad selection of mix-ready presets engineered by Ruston as well as a basic collection of grooves and fills performed by Friedl are included. If you’re in need of an EZX fuming with raw, unadulterated heavy rock energy – captured by two of today’s best using the best of gear in a room that simply has heavy rock written all over it – this EZX is for you.`,

    description: `HiDERA | 15 November 2024 | 1.5 GB Join Cubase expert Gary Hiebner for an in-depth video course on using automation in Cubase to produce more interesting, dynamic mixes, solve issues, and create engaging effects. If you haven’t tried using automation before, you don’t know what you’re missing. This course will provide numerous examples that illustrate the usefulness and creativity of automation. Whether you want to simply create some auto-panning effects or get a bit more creative with delay throws and more, you’ll learn how to do it quickly and easily. These videos are designed for Cubase users new to the subject of automation. Gary begins the course with an overview of everything that’s going to be covered—a bird’s-eye view of automation and some common things that can be done with it. Then he starts to get specific, first looking at panning automation. He presents several possible uses for this idea, such as panning instruments narrower in verses and wider for the chorus. Then it’s on to volume automation, where you’ll learn how to create more interest in the mix by keeping the levels dynamic and fluid. Gary then demonstrates how combining two can yield a range of effects, from subtle to extreme.  Next, you’ll delve into the concept of automating effect send levels and parameters. This includes automating the volume level and feedback of a delay to plug-in, thereby creating a delay throw, which is a delay on a single word or phrase. Gary then builds a whole effects chain and shows how to automate the send level for the chain so that several effects can go on and off at once. Other ideas covered include creating a filter sweep (by automating the cut-off and resonance parameters of a filter), modulation effects (automating depth and rate for tremolo, panners, etc.), creating silence (automating send levels to make sure no reverbs or delays spill over into a section that’s meant to be completely silent), automating instruments (converting a drum hit to a sample and then automating pitch, cut-off frequency, and panning of the drum), and synth modulation (automating parameters like envelopes or LFOs on a synth plug-in). Automation is often a great untapped resource that can serve many purposes—from creative to practical—and this video course is a quick, easy, and fun way to learn how it works in Cubase. Check out the individual Cubase Automation video tutorial descriptions for more information on all that’s covered in this series and ideas on how to implement automation in your own productions. Once you get started, you’ll likely find plenty of ways you can liven up your mixes. Put Cubase to work for you… Watch “Cubase Automation Explained®” now! What You Will Learn:\n-How to create evolving stereo spread effects and mix interest with panning automation.\n-Combining volume and panning automation to produce effects from subtle to extreme.\n-Automating the level and feedback parameters of a delay plug-in to produce “delay throws.”\n-Creating filter sweeps by automating the cut-off frequency and resonance parameters on a filter.\n-And more!`,

    description: `English | 100 pages | PDF | 43 MB This is something special. With an exciting new boxset in the shops any day now, the latest Electronic Sound cover stars are the magnificent Throbbing Gristle and we’re bundling the issue with a limited edition red vinyl seven-inch featuring two previously unreleased TG tracks, including one of the last two recordings the industrial pioneers ever made. We’re looking back over the story of Throbbing Gristle this issue, interviewing the surviving members of the band and others associated with TG. Genesis P-Orridge, Cosey Fanni Tutti, Chris Carter and Peter “Sleazy” Christopherson ripped up all the rules, both sonically and visually, both as a live act and a recording unit. They are widely recognised as the prime movers of industrial music, but their influence and impact stretches way beyond any particular genre. Their early gigs attracted everybody from acid-fried hippies and spotty anarcho-punks to oddball alt-funkateers and hot-wired electronics freaks. There has never been another group even remotely like Throbbing Gristle.  Talking of unique artists, elsewhere in the magazine we also have interviews with The Orb, as Alex Paterson celebrates the release of a career-spanning collection, and one-time Virgin Prunes frontman Gavin Friday, who returns with his first solo album in more than a decade. Plus Field Music, Memorials, Jill Fraser, The Woodentops, The Go! Team, Xeno & Oaklander, Dreadzone and Public Service Broadcasting. Oh, and not forgetting Mirror System, Steve Hillage and Miquette Giraudy’s blissed-out offshoot of System 7. Prepare yourself for maximum cosmic vibes! We have an amazing Throbbing Gristle seven-inch to accompany the magazine. Pressed on glorious red vinyl, neither of these tracks has been released before. The weighty and eerie ‘Wotwududo’, which features a hypnotic vocal performance by Genesis P-Orridge, is from one of the band’s very last studio sessions, while ‘Trumpet Herald’ is a potent and inventive live piece built around Cosey Fanni Tutti’s cornet work. The tracks were recorded in late 2005 and early 2006, during a trip to play two shows in Berlin on New Year’s Eve and New Year’s Day. “Everything we did in TG had to be of the moment,” says Cosey. “And if the moment wasn’t right, then it wasn’t going to work. So you just had to be patient. Wonderful things come from being patient.” As with all our music releases, this record is strictly limited and is only available to readers of Electronic Sound, so make sure you get your copy right away.`,

    description: `TEAM LaptopSolution | 15 November 2024 | 11.4 MB .: AAX, VST, VST3, x64 :. Elevate is the most advanced mastering plug-in ever created. This unique multi-band limiter, human-ear EQ and powerful audio maximizer will increase the loudness of your mix while maintaining or improving its dynamic perception. It uses intelligent, adaptive technology that responds in real time to your music; creating not only the loudest, but the best sounding master. Elevate maintains subtle dynamics and improves the tonal balance of your mix. The adaptive limiter analyzes 26 frequency bands and alters the gain, speed and transients for each band in real time. The result is a transparent, natural sound, no matter how hard you push it. Elevate utilizes 26 critical filter bands modeled from the human ear. Each of the bands are spaced to give maximum control over how the sound hits your eardrum. Draw curves, solo bands and manipulate the transient attack for each individual band to bring out particular instruments such as kick or snare drums.  Adaptive Technology\nElevate uses artificial intelligence algorithms to make it easy for you to get the best sounds, but you can still get under the hood for as much precise control as you desire. This includes giving you control over the tonal balance and transients inside the final limiting stage. The adaptive algorithms reduce audible artifacts and the additional controls give you maximum flexibility with professional results. Features:\n– Analyzes and alters the gain, speed and transients of each filter band in real time.\n– Includes presets by: APS Mastering, Matt Lange, Jeremy Lubsey, Eric Beam, ROCAsound, Chris Tabron and John McCaig.\n– Automatically adapts the attack, release and look-ahead parameters for each filter band to greatly reduce “pumping” and breathing artifacts and perceived distortion.\n– Preserves or emphasizes fast transients to avoid squashing your mix.\n– Manipulates transients across the critical bands to preserve the attacks from kick drums, snares and cymbals, without affecting the entire mix.\n– Uses linear phase auditory filters — based on the Mel Scale — to manipulate the audio in a way that is natural to your inner ear.\n– Solo the output of one band (or a number of bands) to hone in on problem frequencies, tweak transients or alter gain.\n– Use the Auto Output Level feature to compare the limited signal to non-limited signals with the same amount of gain allowing you to easily hear what impact the processing is having on your sound.\n– Use the Spectral Clipper to overdrive the final output without affecting the tonal balance or allowing the signal to get “tubby.” Perfect for a more aggressive sound.\n– Six different types of metering allow you to keep an eye on every aspect of your output audio. ELEVATE MASTERING BUNDLE CONTAINS…\n– ELEVATE – Mastering Limiter with a Brain\n– SATURATE – Spectral Clipper & Psychoacoustic Overdrive\n– PUNCTUATE – Intelligent Transient Shaper\n– EQUIVOCATE – Human Ear EQ ﻿ Changelog:\nv1.13.9 (7/18/2024)\n– Fixed potential UI lockup`,

With Gate, Hold, Pitch, Velocity, CC Lanes and Scale Quantization, SEQUND Lite retains the core features of the original SEQUND, offering a focused tool for exploring polyrhythms and instant generation without the extra bells and whistles. Each lane has an independent length, facilitating the generation of complex polyrhythms and evolving patterns with ease. Whether creating bass lines with subtle variations or unexpected melodies in a blink, SEQUND Lite’s intuitive interface enhances your creative process and calls for exploration.  Each user preset contains up to 12 patterns that can be recalled instantly via MIDI notes, allowing seamless pattern changes and precise timing. The Transpose function is available before or after scale quantization, enabling you to shift your melody and stay in key or act as a traditional transpose. All main global parameters can be automated via your DAW, and you can use SEQUND Lite with soft synths as well as hardware synths. We have retained and improved the randomization and step lock features for instant sequence generation and increased control over your sequences. Newly designed presets by both talented newcomers and established legends, including Boris Werner, Distilled Noise, DJ Bone, Julie Marghilano, La Boum Fatale, Luise, Luna Ludmila, Monty Luke, and Vince Watson, are included to get you started.`,

If you’re having trouble getting your kick to sound right, you’ve come to the right place! In this KICK 3 video course, you’ll learn how to shape every aspect of your kick quickly and with confidence. By the end of the course, you’ll start to wonder how you ever designed kick sounds without KICK 3! These KICK 3 videos are designed for new users. Larry starts off with a brief tour of the interface to make sure everyone is up to speed and knows what’s what before we dive in. Then he covers the toolbar options, including the managing of presets, so you’ll know how to save and recall your work. Explore the Edit area afterward and learn how to choose from various display options and select various presets for Sub and Click samples. Next, Larry covers the Envelope panel, with which you can create and edit nodes for both the Sub and Click pitch and amplitude, followed by the specific Sub and Click controls like global pitch, pan, length, and more. Then you’ll see how to apply onboard effects in various routing configurations.  There’s more to come as well, such as the import feature (importing and analyzing any kick sample, which can be used as a reference), the trigger feature (for side-chaining purposes), the EQ/limiter (final tonal shaping), and more. There’s no need to settle for a less-than-amazing kick sound anymore. This course will quickly show you how to master Kick 3 and build incredible kick sounds faster than ever. See the individual KICK 3 video tutorial descriptions for more info on everything covered in the course and how this plug-in can transform your kick design process. Stop kicking yourself over wimpy kick sounds… Watch “KICK 3 Explained®” now! What You Will Learn:\n-Interface layout and preset management.\n-Using the Envelope panel to edit and create nodes for pitch and amplitude.\n-Shaping the kick sound with control parameters for the Sub and Click.\n-Importing and analyzing an external kick sample to be used as a reference in your track.\n-And more!`,

    description: `HiDERA | 29 December 2024 | 116 MB If you’re curious about how to use new layered sample VI based on guitars and stringed instruments from around the world, well, fret no more. Veteran Groove3 instructor Larry Holcombe will guide you step-by-step through Kithara, teaching you how to adjust all the parameters and utilize all the features to quickly create evocative and inspiring sounds. Whether you want to create ambient, evolving landscapes for a film/TV score or dress up that beat with some unconventional sounds, it’s all here. These Kithara videos are designed for new users. Larry begins with a brief overview of the plug-in, so you can understand its basic architecture, followed by a tour of the interface to help you get your bearings. He then moves on to the Main and Layers pages, where you’ll spend most of your time. You’ll learn how to select different samples for the four different layers (Attack, Sustain 1, Sustain 2, and Release), blend them in different amounts, edit the amp envelopes, and more. Next, Larry covers the Fragments page, where you can create randomized “fragment” fluttering effects to complement the fundamental layers and tickle the ears in unpredictable ways. Then, you’ll explore the FX page, where you’ll get access to spatial and other granular effects to further decorate your sounds. Other topics include the Settings page (for global controls, etc.), modulating your sound (using the mod wheel to add movement and life to patches), the source browser (for organizing sounds), and more.  Kithara is an instrument with deep possibilities, and this Kithara video course will help you get the most out of it in the least amount of time. Ideal for cinematic soundscapes, of course, but capable of much more, this course will help you learn how to use it confidently regardless of genre. Check out the individual Kithara video tutorial descriptions for more information on everything this plug-in can do and for ideas on how you can use it in your own productions. Step into a world of sonic exploration… Watch “Kithara Explained®” now! What You Will Learn:\n-Interface layout and plug-in architecture.\n-How to select samples for each of the four layers and blend and tweak them with various parameters.\n-Add fluttering, randomized “ear candy” elements to your sound with the Fragments page.\n-Various ways to modulate sound using the mod wheel, creating movement and liveliness.\n-And more!`,

    description: `Team V.R | 14 November 2024 | 3.6GB …::: AAX, VST3,VST, x64 :::… The v2 update is focused mainly on modulation in our hosts with a bunch of new modulators available, along with other functionality and workflow updates which will open up new worlds of creativity. One particularly fabulous aspect of this update is that Snap Heap and Multipass now have the same modular modulation system as Phase Plant, which allows you to combine and connect as many modulators as you need. This unleashes limitless new creative possibilities for creating dynamic, evolving, responsive, or chaotic modular effects within these already super-useful Snapin Hosts.  New Modulators for all Snapin Hosts\nCurve\nMSEGs done the Kilohearts way.\nOur new Curve modulator allows you to draw detailed modulation shapes of any length with the option to set and modulate loop points with a five loop modes and a selection of trigger options.\nUse the Curve Editor to quickly and accurately create new curves using point, free draw, and step draw tools with adjustable grid snapping.  Curve is fantastic for gradual changes over a long time, extended complex modulations, or unique envelopes with custom loops and tails. LFO Table \nCycle through 256 LFO shapes in one modulator. Use a wavetable as a modulation source. A simple concept with many applications.  This unique modulator opens up all kinds of possibilities. Use it to store a bank of rhythmical variations… or a variety of melodic sequences… whatever you can imagine. When combined with a Random modulator, LFO Tables are wonderful for crafting evolving generative patterns. Remap\nMap incoming values to whatever output values you need with custom remap shapes. The Remap utility brings you even more precise control over your modulation. Lock pitch to specific note values, create probability maps, or warp input values in interesting ways. Sample & Hold + Audio Follower + Pitch Track\nHandy modulation utilities that convert incoming signals into modulation values. These utilities were previously only available in Snap Heap and Multipass but have been updated to be a part of the Kilohearts Modulation System. Sample and Hold can be used to grab input values when triggered, the Audio Follower will track the amplitude of an incoming signal and use it to modulate whatever you desire, and the Pitch Tracker will do the same for pitch. New Functionality\n•Modulator Triggers – Envelope, LFO, LFO Table, Curve and Random modulators can all now be triggered to start running when an incoming value reaches a specific threshold.\n•MPE Support – For all you expressive performers out there, all MPE input can now be used to control your sound.\n•Slower LFO Rates – So slow, they stop. Yes, that’s all the way down 0Hz for LFO, LFO Table, Curve and Random modulators.\n•External Automation for any parameter – Ran out of macros again?! Kilohearts v2 saves the day by allowing you to link up to 64 external automation sources directly to almost any parameter. Workflow Improvements\n•Improved visualisation of modulation connections – clearly see modulation connections with just a mouse-hover and navigate complex patches with ease.\n•Updated modulation target menu – target specific values and a quick remap curve.\n•Effects Groups – Combine multiple Snapins into groups to quickly move and copy them.\n•Modulator Groups – Do the same for modulators.\n•Various bugfixes and optimisations.\n•Better colours!

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 23 October 2024 | 10.9 MB PLATFORM: VST2/VST3/AAX(MOD) Maximal 3 is a true-peak brickwall limiter, soft clipper, and broadcast standard loudness meter. Maximal 3 is a loudness maximiser, designed to limit and maximise your track. Featuring both a true-peak brickwall limiter and a variable shape soft clipper, Maximal 3 can increase the overall loudness of your track, without destroying the sonic quality. The limiter features true-peak lookahead detection, meaning inter-sample peaks will never overshoot and clip. With four different modes, and controls for attack and release, the shape of the limiter can achieve anything from transparent limiting with transient preservation, to warm bus gluing or pumping.  Features:\nTrue-Peak Limiting\nMaximal 3 features true-peak, lookahead, brickwall limiting. This means that no matter how hard you push it, there will never be any overshoots from intersample peaks. With four different limiter modes, and attack and release controls, Maximal 3 can be used for anything from clean and transparent loudness maximising, to gluing a bus together. Variable Soft Clipping\nClipping can be used to shave off rampant peaks before limiting, or used as a creative tool to add a bit of warmth to tracks. An adjustable curve from hard to soft allows chopping transients or adding saturation to both individual tracks and whole mixes. Loudness Metering\nMaximal 3 features a dedicated loudness metering section, displaying the LUFS and true-peak value of the signal, based on the ITU-R BS.1770-4 specification. Additionally, you can set the target loudness of the meters to any level, such as for mastering specifically the EBU R128 standard. Oversampling\nTo help limit aliasing and catch inter-sample peaks, Maximal 3 offers up to 16x oversampling. Using linear-phase resampling filters, our high-quality oversampling algorithm cleanly upsamples the signal before applying the limiting, before cleanly bringing the sample rate back to the original.`,

    description: `OHSiE | 16 November 2023 | 7.10 GB …: Hopkin Instrumentarium :… Metaltines is a nuanced and expressive selection of metal lamellaphones, featuring the Mallet K 1 & 2, Sit or Play, and T-Rod-On-Tine. It offers a wide spectrum of playable articulations, ambiences and custom FX presets to give you complete musical freedom. Metaltines is an expressively nuanced assortment of metal lamellaphones from the mind of master instrument inventor Bart Hopkin. Featuring 4 unique instruments with wildly distinctive shapes and mechanics, but with the same sharp, yet richly resonant metal essence that shimmers brightly through each one. It includes the mallet K1 & K2, Sit or Play, and T-Rod-on-Tine. We’ve included a wide spectrum of playable articulations, sound-design textures, pads, drones and multiple microphones/channel options to give you complete musical freedom.  Mallet K 1 and 2 are mallet kalimbas with large, wide metal keys. Playing with mallets tends to favor the overtones more than the fundamental. On the larger K 1, this results in a clangy-sounding mix of overtones. The smaller K 2 makes a very nice bass, as the mallets impart a punchy sound that is different from either plucked tines or strings. Both Mallet K 1 and K 2 feature two mic positions and Mallet K 2 also has a direct line out from the pickup Sit or Play is a set of three benches, each of which has a pair of circular steel tongue drums embedded in the seat. The tone of the tongue drums is greatly enhanced by the combination of the bench tops acting as soundboards and the resonance of the air partially enclosed under the seats. Sit or Play features hard mallet, soft mallet, metal mallet, finger, and hand articulations with two separate mic positions. T-Rod-On-Tine has short lengths of hardened-steel threaded rods attached at right angles near the ends of springsteel tines. These assemblies have various modes of vibration producing multiple frequencies, and different tones are brought out by striking in different ways. To produce all these different sounds, our mallet types included rubber, metal, hard, ping pong, rubber band, pick, finger, and mallet bottom. The result is a wide range of different sounds as the different methods of playing create unique, complex vibrations with swirling overtones and bassy resonance. We’ve faithfully sampled tine plucks and percussive hand slaps on the instrument bodies, with two stereo mic positions. Also included is a wide selection of custom FX presets and plenty of our signature sound designed ambient content, crafted from the raw acoustic source to give you complete creative freedom. Product Specs:\n– 6 Master presets and 20 Custom Sound-Designed FX and Ambient presets\n– 4 Unique Hand-crafted metal lamellophones each with 2 mic positions\n– Percussive knock effects, glisses and bonus ambient effects, pads and drones\n– 24-bit, 48 kHz Stereo Lossless NCW Format.\n– 11,442 Stereo Samples\n– 7.05 GB Installed\n– Made for the free Kontakt Player (version 6+), Komplete Kontrol, all S-Series Keyboards and NKS software and hardware by Native Instruments\n– Works with the Kontakt “Libraries” browser and Native Access.

    description: `Team HCiSO | 27 December 2024 | 1.32GB ..:: Drum Vault Bundle ::.. Intelligent Drum Replacement Audio Fingerprint drum hit detection SuperStart auto-adjustment of settings Outstanding drum sounds included A complete solution…  The world’s first intelligent drum replacer\nWhen creating Addictive Trigger, we developed smart new technologies (Audio Fingerprint™ and SuperStart™) to make drum replacement easy and painless. Then, we combined these new technologies with some of the best sounds and features from Addictive Drums 2. The result is a fast, accurate and fun way to raise your live-recorded drums to a whole new level. ACCURATE AND INTELLIGENT\nDuring the research phase of Addictive Trigger, users around the world reported that accurate hit detection is absolutely critical when using drum replacement plugins. Unfortunately, existing triggering technologies tend to have shortcomings that require lots of manual tweaking and correction. We endeavor to make products that are better than what is currently available, and we ended up creating an entirely new method for drum hit detection called Audio Fingerprint. Our new system uses FFT analysis to accurately identify drum sounds even if there is a lot of mic bleed or background noise in the source material. It’s fast, it’s accurate, and we think it’ll change the way you work with live-recorded drums. SUPERSTART. SUPER FAST.\nSetting and fine-tuning detection parameters can be painfully tedious work. SuperStart eliminates the need to do this by listening to your source material and automatically providing suitable detection settings. In most cases, this is all you need to get accurate drum detection happening on your tracks. This lets you spend more of your time on creative things like dialing in the perfect drum sounds. WORLD-CLASS SOUNDS RIGHT OUT OF THE BOX\nIn addition to the intelligent detection and workflow features, Addictive Trigger ships with tons of fantastic and easily-tweakable presets that are tailored specifically for drum replacement. Selected from the award winning Addictive Drums library, these sounds are recorded at world-class, impossible-to-book studios like Fairfax Recording (formerly known as Sound City) and United Recording (formerly Ocean Way) and utilize some of the finest gear and most experienced ears in the business. Even if you already have nice drums and a great studio, we think you’ll still find a lot of inspiration and benefit from having these world-class sounds at your fingertips. A COMPLETE SOLUTION\nAddictive Trigger works all on its own and does not require any additional software to provide world-class results. Just fire up the plugin and you’re ready to go. Accurate detection and outstanding sounds are included in the box.  → Features:\n✓ Contains Addictive Trigger and Drum Vault Expansion Pack\n✓ Complete drum triggering solution\n✓ Audio Fingerprint drum hit detection\n✓ SuperStart auto-adjustment of settings\n✓ Outstanding drum sounds included Release Notes Merry Christmas 🎄 Supported Operation System:\n• macOS 10.13 or later\n• Apple Silicon or Intel Core processor`,

    description: `MORiA | 05 December 2024 | 2.10 GB ..:: AUi, AAX, STANDALONE, VSTi, VST3i ::.. Legendary Tape Keyboard The Mellotron put an orchestra at the fingertips and redefined what it was to be a keyboard player. Now with modifications never dreamed of in the 1960s, our faithfully modeled reproduction will infuse your sound with updated vintage goodness. From psychedelic rock to rocking your world. In the mid ‘60s, the Mellotron thrilled keyboardists with the ability to play tape-based recordings of actual orchestral instruments—adding its own quirky sonic character. Whether you’re conjuring the classics or creating new ones, adding this vintage sound to your music with Mellotron V is sure to make people sit up and listen. Mellotron V puts the orchestral sounds of classic art rock right in your hands—cape optional. Imagine a pre-digital world where sampling didn’t exist and the only way to incorporate orchestral realism in your music was, well, to hire an actual orchestra. Enter the Mellotron circa 1963. We’ve lovingly re-engineered it in Mellotron V for your music circa today.   What if you placed a tape playback mechanism under each key and fed each one a recording of a single orchestral instrument note? Crazy? Brilliant? Who cares! That ingenuity resulted in the Mellotron and empowered artists like The Beatles, The Moody Blues, Genesis and Yes to perform strings, brass, woodwinds and more without hiring a room full of session players. The imperfections of tape flutter and other 1960s electronics yielded a sort of alt-universe version of these traditional instruments. In today’s world of pristine sampling, that contrast has brought the “Tron” sound back into vogue at the hands of artists like Caro Emerald, Vampire Weekend and Kasabian. Main Features:\n– 65 original tape racks from MKI/MKII/M300/M400 Mellotrons\n– User sample import: benefit from the Mellotron sound on any sample\n– 3 tracks to select or blend samples\n– Modeling parameters and modulations: flutter, tape saturation, mechanics noise, noise floor, velocity on volume and aftertouch on flutter\n– Amplitude envelope and loop controls for each sample\n– Time stretching on user samples\n– Dedicated effects pedal board\n– 4 slots with a selection of 10 different effects\n– 1 amplifier simulator (Fender Twin or Leslie)\n– 1 room ambiance\n– 61 presets`,

Emulator II V is a multitimbral sampling machine that brings E-Mu Systems’ seminal digital workhorse back to life in all its nostalgic glory – with a slick modern edge. Its unique combination of high-fidelity 8-bit sound, warm analog filter, and instantly-recognizable sample library is sure to spark instant creativity, just as the original once did. When you want lo-fi grain, ‘80s sheen, or a sampling flow that stands out from the crowd, look no further.  Digital goes lo-fi\nPart sampler, part synth, Emulator II V combines 8-bit digital crunchiness with warm analog filters for a distinctly lo-fi sound that’ll add instant character to any mix. The sound of the ‘80s\nIf you’ve heard Depeche Mode, New Order, Genesis, John Carpenter, or pretty much anyone from the ‘80s & ‘90s, you’ve heard the Emulator sound – now it’s in your hands. No ordinary emulation\nUsing our exclusive TAE® technology, every circuit and every function of this classic instrument has been remade in detail to sound & behave just like the original. The sounds you know\nSome of popular music’s most iconic sounds came from the original Emulator libraries; Emulator II V combines them with a fresh & dynamic selection of samples for your mixes. Vintage DAC\nA drum loop played first in Modern mode, then with the “Vintage” DAC. And if you want the samples in your mix to bring a vibe of their own, what better way than to use a sampler straight from the old school? Choose between a modern DAC or a faithful emulation of the original hardware’s DAC and let the lo-fi vibes roll… Synth brain\nInstrument first, sampler second. Part of what made the Emulator hardware so popular was the fact that it behaved like a synthesizer, but with the flexibility of using samples – its multitimbrality meant up to 8 samples could be played at once on your keyboard.`,

Our enhancements translate to vastly expanded possibilities for sound design and avant-garde music. You’ve always wanted to paint with sound. Now you can with the Buchla Easel V. One look at the Buchla Easel V and you know this is a different beast. In fact, it makes you think differently about sound right from the start—and the soundscapes you can design with it are as unique as the front panel array. To put that experience at your fingertips, we meticulously recreated the rare 1973 Buchla Music Easel right down to the component level. As you’ve come to expect from our other V-series instruments, we’ve gone the extra mile by designing in an enhanced feature set including polyphony, innovative new modulation/control sources, step sequencer, effects, and more. If you like to paint outside the lines, Buchla Easel V is the perfect artistic tool for you.  Welcome to West Coast school of synthesis\nYour music breaks from the pack. So does the Buchla Easel V.\nThe Buchla Easel V faithfully reproduces Buchla’s Music Easel that helped define West Coast synthesis’ focus on experimentation and breaking musical norms. We’ve applied our award-winning TAE™ modeling technology from the front panel to the resistors to capture it all with incredible realism. Complex oscillator design, AM and FM synthesis, uniquely percussive gate/filter combos, and numerous ways to modulate and clock just about every parameter, all drop you right in the middle of a sonic sandbox. Design and perform soundscapes that burble, shimmer, pulse and evolve without ever touching a keyboard or pad—unless you want to add even more control. Nearly 300 presets by expert sound designers get you started with timbres ranging from hauntingly beautiful sonorities to clangorous pokes in the ear. Whether you’re looking to experiment with simple sounds or build complex evolving passages, the Buchla Easel V is a constant source of inspiration for sonic adventurers. Create sounds no one has ever heard before\nIn addition to faithfully reproducing a classic, we’ve infused the Buchla Easel V with even more of that vintage goodness to love.\nWe’ve made patching even more fun and foolproof. When you drag a color-coded patchcord between patch points, only valid targets light up, saving you the frustration of making invalid connections that do nothing. The original Music Easel lacked a noise source, so we’ve added one to the preamp—handy for introducing rhythmic elements. We’ve also designed a feedback loop into the preamp, so you can really get things howling. Up to four-voice polyphony greatly enhances your performance capabilities, too.*  With our extensions to Buchla’s original design, you now have an even more intuitive programming experience paired with additional sonic options.\n* Note that while our extreme modeling at the component level on the Buchla Easel V delivers insanely great analog sound, each voice of polyphony requires significant processing power to pull it off—approximately 20 percent of an i7 CPU per voice. New control, new inspiration\nElectronic music is as much about expression as it is about sound generation—and Buchla Easel V delivers new expressive capabilities beyond your wildest dreams.\nWe’ve dramatically expanded the functionality of the original Music Easel while respecting the instrument’s unique personality and design philosophy. One click reveals all the new additions. The Left Hand section provides five full-featured Function Generators individually routable to any of 76 modulation targets. The Right Hand section gives you a modern step sequencer with innovative options. Gravity is an X/Y grid that uses the physics of a bouncing ball influenced by attraction, repulsion and collision with objects to generate unique, unexpected modulation signals. There’s also a two-slot Effects section for additional processing and animation right inside Buchla Easel V.`,

Browsing, editing, mixing, EQing, tone matching, exporting… Cataloged but beyond being an IR (impulse response) loader, Cabinetron would be your one and only tool to find every missing process between your amp and your ears.  Mission One: Sound Quality\nYou may have an extensive IR collection, but please do not waste your precious resources on an IR loader that doesn’t sound good enough. Believe or not, every IR loader does sound different, even if they share the same algorithm. and the secret that makes the difference is the rounding errors in convolution DSP codes.\nSound quality is always the first thing that matters to us. Just like Adaptive Filter Topologies that we created for Kirchhoff-EQ, we designed a noise-shaping algorithm exclusively for IR convolution, to ensure every of your IR is ‘pushing the air’ in Cabinetron.\nOptional Non-linear Enhancement A guitar cabinet can be simulated well enough by convolution because 99% of the cabinet / speaker’s behavior is linear. But what about the last 1% of nonlinearity? Not only as a transparent linear IR loader, Cabinetron also modeled the non-linear behavior of how the voice coil moves within the magnet. With the enhancement of nonlinearity, more real cabinet-like all your IR’s will be, and more ‘3D’ your tone will sound. Of course, you have full control of this parameter. Tweak it or leave it, it’s up to you.  LaptopSolution: A witch says, MERRY XMAS!`,

    description: `TCD | 16 June 2024 | 12.6 MB Scanner Vibrato is a virtual effect plug-in that aims to recreate the scanner-vibrato effect from a well-known tonewheel organ. The original scanner-vibrato was developed in the 1940s, and was an analog, electromechanical device, consisting of an analog delay line and a mechanical rotor (“scanner”). The rotor was driven by the organ’s internal motor, and therefore its rate was fixed at about 6.9 Hz. The original scanner-vibrato could produce both chorus and vibrato effects, and it offered three depth presets. Read more about the history of the Scanner Vibrato.  Features:\nMartinic Scanner Vibrato is modelled closely on the original scanner-vibrato, so it offers the same features (and flaws), perfectly preserving the character of the original effect. However, Scanner Vibrato is more flexible; you can adjust the rate, depth, and even stereo width. And best of all, you can apply Scanner Vibrato not only to organ sounds, but also to guitar, synthesizer, or whatever sound you like.  Version 1.4.1 (June 12, 2024)\n– Fixed crash with VST3 in Blue Cat’s PatchWork.\n– Fixed VST3 failing examination in Digital Performer 11.\n– Fixed VST3 speaker arrangement.\n– Fixed CLAP resize issue with scaled GUI in REAPER on Windows.\n– Fixed GUI color space on macOS Sonoma.`,

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 03 December 2024 | 6.75 GB ..:: STANDALONE, AAX, VSTi, VST3, x64 ::.. (ACTP) presents a Chinese ethnic percussion ensemble, covering a wide range from bass to treble, including membrane, wood, and brass instruments. It includes 19 instrument slots totaling 49 percussion instruments, such as drum ensemble, solo drum, gongs, cymbals, opera percussion, and vocals. Each instrument features multiple articulations, velocity layers, and sample cycles.  Main Features:\nDual-Layer Mixer\n– The ACTP adopts a dual-layer mixer design. The first layer is the instrument track, and each instrument track contains multiple microphone tracks. This setup is to adapt to the diverse nature of Chinese percussion, as the miking configuration for drum ensembles and small wood percussion differs. However, every percussion instrument uses the same overhead microphones to ensure tonal consistency. Percussion Version of Riffer\n– Quickly mark articulations and expressions in the built-in piano roll.\n– Fully compatible with standard MIDI, with lossless import/export.\n– Each preset is accompanied by a riff, presenting a quick overview of the performances and sound characteristics.\n– Each instrument slot contains similar types of percussion with consistent design in terms of articulations, velocity layers, and sample cycles. When switching between instruments in the same slot, there is no need to modify the MIDI. Even for drum ensemble vs. solo, simply shifting the MIDI by an octave can achieve the same performance. Legato\nAmple Sound’s legato technology from Dizi, Xiao, and Erhu is introduced to percussion. Instruments like Gongs, Cymbals, Singing Bowls, Temple Bowls, and Bells feature various legato expression changes, such as striking a Singing Bowl first and then legato into a Sing (the effect of a mallet rubbing continuously around the rim).`,

    description: `MORiA | 20 October 2024 | 140.99 MB ..: STANDALONE | AUi | VST3i :.. The legendary VOX Continental organ is faithfully recreated in software as the VOX Super Continental! Originally conceived in the early 1960s as a more portable and affordable alternative to tonewheel organs, the VOX Continental’s distinctive sound – and its sharp red-and-black design – soon made it a staple of “British Invasion” bands. The Continental’s bright timbre and brash attitude fit perfectly with jangly guitars, and easily cut through the mix on stage and in the studio. Production stopped around 1970, but a new generation of ska, garage, punk, and new wave bands adopted the instruments in the ‘70s and ‘80s. Weathered and worn through decades of use, and none-too-stable to begin with, the instruments tend to be charmingly out of tune. As the key contacts aged, each note started to sound slightly different. With this unique voice, a combination of electric tone and vintage character, the Vox Continental is a fixture of stage and studio – particularly in indie music.  The KORG Collection VOX Super Continental began as a careful re-creation of a number of Continental keyboards, including a beloved instrument personally owned by the primary software engineer, in order to get the best possible representation of the Super Continental sound performance. This analysis included such details as the behavior of hundreds of individual key contacts – and is the most accurate VOX Continental software instrument available anywhere! Calibrated character\nThe VOX Continental’s oscillators are based on unstable germanium transistors. The octave-divider circuits mean that octaves are always pure, but all other intervals can be at least subtly out of tune (and often much more so). This produces a distinctive chorusing effect when playing chords, and gives melodies a touch of extra flavor. Individual notes are made by combining overtones from the drawbars. Each key has up to five key contact wires, one for each drawbar. When each wire hits its drawbar bus, that overtone sounds (often along with a tiny burst of noise). The contacts are usually worn and misaligned after all these years, and so the wires hit the drawbar buses at slightly different times. This lends every note a unique character at note-on and note-off. All of these imperfections are lovingly modeled, and Calibration controls let you dial in as much or as little of them as you like. Refined user experience\nSmooth Sound Transitions let previously-played voices and effects continue naturally when you change sounds. KORG’s sophisticated sound browser supports categories, text search, and more. On-screen help provides information and useful tips for every drawbar, knob, and switch. Effects\nThe VOX Super Continental was almost always played through an amp, so of course we include a selection of amp and cabinet models, along with a stunningly detailed rotary speaker. There are two insert effects before the amp, another insert after it, and finally a dedicated reverb slot. For the inserts you can choose between 30 effects types, including everything from vintage pedals and tape delay to modern reverse delays and shimmer reverb.`,

The finest vintage EP sounds now available in the KORG Collection The electric piano sound engine EP-1 first appeared in 2011 in KORG’s flagship workstation synthesizer, KRONOS. It adopted the newly developed MDS (Multi-Dimensional Synthesis) technology which expresses smooth and dynamic tonal changes finely corresponding to key touch, something previous sample playback methods could not achieve. In 2017, it was featured in the top-tier Korg stage piano Grandstage, and in 2021, a new electric piano model was added to the NAUTILUS workstation. This plugin version now features the latest EP-1 sound engine and has received new voicing, making it the definitive Electric Piano sound engine. The overwhelmingly realistic sound and dynamic expression of EP-1 will stir the player’s soul and unleash deep emotional responses. Experience the latest EP-1 sound engine and expand your creative horizons.  Discover the EP-1\nEP-1 superbly reproduces the sound of seven classic tine-type, reed-type electric pianos, and vintage effects with high precision. Using KORG’s carefully developed Multi-Dimensional Synthesis (MDS) technology, EP-1 delivers natural and real-time expression, unattainable with traditional sample playback methods. From pianissimo to fortissimo, EP-1 provides smooth and natural dynamic changes without noticeable transitions, this is a true musical “instrument.” By controlling noise elements, such as mechanical key-off noise with release velocity in real-time, it enables unprecedented realistic and detailed performance. What is the MDS sound engine?\nMulti-Dimensional Synthesis (MDS) is Korg’s proprietary sound engine system. In developing EP-1, we first meticulously sampled the tonal changes produced by electric pianos across a wide range of keystroke strengths, and selected from the finest individual electric pianos that offer excellent playability as the source instruments. By separating the pitch components and noise components such as hammer and key release and re-synthesizing them under separate control, we were able to recreate all the tonal changes of electric pianos. As a result, we achieved a sound engine system that reacts extremely naturally to player control, with sound editing performance, touch sensitivity, and temporal changes in sound that could not be expressed with normal sample playback methods. The smooth tonal changes from soft to intense touch are naturally free of the noticeable boundaries typical of velocity switching. Temporal changes such as decay and release also achieve a natural feeling, different from those produced by envelope generators. Diverse Electric Piano Sounds\nFrom the ’60s to today, electric piano sounds have been an essential part of many musical styles and genres. The EP-1 delivers an extensive array of sounds, from classic electric piano tones to aggressive plucked piano sounds through a guitar amp, and hammer sounds that emphasize the attack components of tines. With 50 reinterpreted electric piano sounds utilizing the MDS engine, the EP-1 will add vibrant new colors to your sonic palette.`,

    description: `Intrinsic | 14 March 2015 | 18 GB …: Korg M3 Synth/Sampler :.. (.NKI, .EXS, .FXP, .WAV, .SXT) Keyboard workstations have always been something of a Korg speciality, ever since they created the concept almost 20 years ago with the M1. Does their latest offering, the M3, live up to its pedigree? About once a decade, Korg rewrite the rules for making music on affordable keyboards. In 1988, the M1 defined what we call a workstation. Nothing that it embodied was new: PCM samples, sequencing and effects had all been used in keyboards from other manufacturers, but the ‘AI’ architecture of the M1 did it more elegantly and more affordably than it had ever been done before. Then, in 1995, the Trinity introduced the combination of touchscreens, genuinely multitimbral effects, hard disk recording and digital I/O to the mainstream keyboard world. Not only was the Trinity radical in the way that it combined these technologies, but the price — as it had been for the M1 — was remarkable for such a groundbreaking product.  111Behind the scenes, both of these instruments took advantage of advances in hardware technology. The M1 was made possible by the emergence of VLSI chips and, once fabricated, these found their way into almost everything that the company made, from guitar effects units to recording workstations. Likewise, the Trinity’s hardware would have been impractical before the mid-’90s but, once the barriers had been overcome, touchscreens and multitimbral effects began to be adopted. In 2005, the OASYS appeared. Again, this recombined existing concepts to create a groundbreaking instrument, but it was not what you would call affordable, so it didn’t really follow in the footsteps of the M1 or the Trinity. That honour belongs, perhaps, to the subject of this review, the M3, which marries a combination of OASYS-based software and innovative hardware in a radically new instrument. Korg have described the M3 as their ‘third­generation workstation’, after the M1 and the Trinity (and their respective descendants). But is this fair? Does the M3 herald the birth of a new generation, or is it the evolution of the OASYS into the mainstream of the workstation market?

Dizi is a Chinese transverse flute-like instrument made of the bamboo trunk. Unlike similar instruments, Dizi has a bulrush-made membrane that vibrates with airflow, making up its uniquely clear and bright sound. Dizi is an incredibly expressive instrument. Besides its smooth and beautiful melodic parts, Dizi can be played with a rich set of performances, such as rapid finger-popping, tongue-flutter, and airflow vibrato, allowing Dizi to play the most complex solo parts. There are two major variants of Dizi: Qudi (literally melodic Dizi), which is usually used for playing solo works as the primary instrument of complex work, and it is what we present here in Whisper of Loong; and Bangdi (literally opera Dizi), with its very bright sound, is usually served as the accompanying instrument of traditional Chinese opera.  Adjustable Sound Field.\n– When samples were recorded, 10 different microphones were used with different positions to capture the spatial and reverb characteristics of Dizi. All these channels were mixed down to four channels: Yin, Yang and far stereo. The volumes of these four channels were adjustable in software, making it possible to obtain most various tone: Performances.\n– By controlling airflow and finger, Dizi has a very rich set of performances such as mordent, finger pole popping, trill, flutter, vibrato, staccato and gliss. All these performances can be triggered in Whisper of Loong software, making it most adjustable Dizi virtual instrument: Realistic Expressions.\n– Whisper of Loong has real-recorded expressions that are freely controllable. With the control of MIDI CC, it can express tone changes like a real Dizi performance: Gliss.\n– With three different speeds of real-recorded gliss samples and sample synthesis technique, Whisper of Loong can perform gliss at freely adjustable speed: Self-developed Vibrato Engine.\n– Real-sample-based LFO engine making Whisper of Loong performs vibrato that is both realistic and adjustable: Sampling Engine.\n– Self-developed sampling engine with better sound quality, more powerful disk buffer streaming/sampling compression technology, and brand-new sound fusion technology: Legato.\n– We recorded the sound between legato notes in two speeds, and apply them according to playing speed in software. In addition, we recorded “popping legato” that are specific in Chinese Dizi: Convolution reverb.\n– At the beginning of Chinese Traditional series development, we started to record the convolution reverb samples from spectacular places, famous natural and historical heritages in China. Thus you can simulate Whisper of Loong being played at the Great Wall or Terracotta Army site: Effect Rack.\n– From the Heavier7Strings’ effect rack: Compressor, EQ, Chorus and Ping-Pong delay are included, allowing to create more flexible sounds: Pattern Library.\n– Complete pattern library allowing to manage your works and ideas easily, with rich preset of patterns that can be updated in the future. And you could create your own pattern by dragging MIDI clips inside: Presets.\n– Various presets from Chinese traditional to experimental to the edge.  LaptopSolution: A witch says, MERRY XMAS!`,

Deep Vintage is a suite of legendary hardware simulation plugins that will immerse you in real analog magic. Not merely pursuing bona fide circuit replication or specific tonal qualities, Deep Vintage simulates the entirety of sound to reproduce the vintage “soul” in a digital world. Depth, sheen, low-end saturation…every nuance of the hardware’s sonic spirit is ready for you to ignite, with minimal CPU usage and latency.  APNN 2.0\nTrained with proprietary APNN (Audio Processing Neural Network) 2.0, Deep Vintage learns on sound, and sound alone, creating an indistinguishable listening experience from the original hardwares.\nAPNN 2.0 is a neural network specializes in simulating analog hardwares. During the training process, APNN 2.0 and the hardware will be inputted with the same audio, and APNN 2.0 will learn how the hardware changes the audio in both waveform and spectrum dimensions. This means that a well-trained APNN 2.0 instance can capture both the dynamic and tonal characteristics of its source hardware. The following diagram demonstrates how, as training progresses, APNN 2.0’s waveform and spectrum response deviation gradually decrease, eventually becoming indistinguishable from that of the original hardware. Check out the corresponding demos below to hear how APNN 2.0 progressively learns and replicates the sound of the hardware. The Deep Vintage – 12-in-1 Complete Bundle includes:\n– Brit 73: Inspired by the most legendary preamp on this planet. This class-A, transistor preamp with EQ epitomizes the beauty of sound, offering unparalleled clarity, sheen, and bite.\n– Brit 84: Inspired by the original model of a preamp as coveted as Brit 73, Brit 84 features additional frequency bands, a unique ‘High Q’ mode, and an extra Low Pass filter. However, Brit 84 is not simply an ‘advanced version’ of Brit 73, as each delivers distinct sound characteristics.\n– US Rack: Inspired by a legendary ‘US’ style channel strip that features a preamp, a line-driver, and a renowned EQ, US Rack delivers a highly musical and rich analog sound while maintaining extraordinary flexibility.\n– Thick Pre: Inspired by a legendary vintage-style preamp known for its thick, warm, and smooth sound, this model features a ‘Presence’ control to enhance additional harmonics, and a unique ‘Deep’ switch that can make your sound even larger and thicker.\n– Transformer X: Other than electron tubes, the most tone-defining component in hardware circuits is the transformer—especially vintage transformers with their signature ‘iron sound’. Inspired by a custom ‘color box’ utilizing a vintage US transformer, Transformer X can easily add warmth, body, and low-end girth to your sound.\n– Green AD: Does it make any difference when we directly connect an AD (Analog to Digital converter) to a DA (Digital to Analog converter) ? Absolutely yes. Inspired by a world’s top-tier AD/DA converter, Green AD brings analog warmth into the digital world.\n– Nylon: Inspired by a unique and captivating circuit, Nylon offers two modes of coloration: Yellow for shimmering highs and Green for robust lows. Both are ‘Transparent Overdrive’ effects that add subtle harmonic content, gentler than typical saturators. The Yellow mode mainly generates harmonics at high frequencies, giving a bright, polished ‘shine.’ The Green mode mainly adds saturation at low frequencies, making bass, kick drum, or drum bus more massive and aggressive.\n– Tube Shelf: Inspired by one of the most iconic and musical program EQs of all time, Tube Shelf faithfully emulates the EQ characteristics and unique tonal coloration of the original tube electronics. The Tube Shelf module is primarily used to adjust low and high frequencies. With relatively few frequency band options, it is often paired with other EQs for more detailed tonal shaping, most commonly with Tube Bell and Tube Filter modules.\n– Tube Bell: As a complement to Tube Shelf, Tube Bell is primarily responsible for mid-frequency processing. It features two Peak sections and a Dip section, all utilizing Bell-type filters.\n– Tube Filter: Tube Filter reinforces Tube Shelf and Tube Bell with High Cut and Low Cut. Though High Cut is less common in mixing, Tube Filter’s smooth, natural High Cut excels at ‘darkening’ sound when necessary.\n– Tape S: Inspired by a 1/4-inch tape machine from the late ’80s – early ’90s which is favored by many professionals for its unique sonic signature, Tape S delivers exceptional sound quality in mixing. Characterized by its warm midranges, smooth high ends, and rich harmonics, it enhances depth and richness in any bus or master mix.\n– Tape M: Inspired by a legendary 2-track tape machine from ’70s Germany, Tape M delivers a warm, distinctive character with a lively low end. Due to its earlier origins, it has a richer coloration and slightly more pronounced wow/flutter. When driven slightly hotter, it adds subtle harmonic distortion to help achieve loudness without excessive compression, making it a refined tool for mixdowns or mastering.

    description: `ARTiCSTORM | 02 December 2024 | 29.64 MB Whether you want precise control over complex patterns or ways to generate new ideas, this Pack of Max For Live Sequencers will open up all kinds of possibilities in your music-making. Sequencers are a fundamental component in electronic music production, responsible for triggering samples and telling synths which notes to play. They can also be used for many other functions relating to making sound move, and they come in many different forms. In this Pack, you can get your hands on three different Sequencers built in Max for Live by Ableton device designers. Each Sequencer has its own quirks and potential uses, but they all promise rewarding and surprising results for anyone who spends time exploring them.  Step Arp\nStep Arp deals with one of the most popular uses for a sequencer, to create arpeggios. Compared to Ableton’s native Arpeggiator, StepArp’s sequence can be controlled and altered step-by-step, defining six different values including velocity, note length, chance and transposition. It’s the sequencer to use when writing melodic parts, with more than enough controls to tweak for variations while recording or during a performance. SQ Sequencer\nSQ Sequencer takes its inspiration from classic hardware sequencers, providing up to 16 steps to control a range of parameters. Crucially, each parameter lane can cycle through its own step length and playback direction, which allows for more detailed control over the way your pattern evolves. The Condition feature can determine precise rules for when a step will or won’t trigger a MIDI value. When these various settings get pushed in different directions, you can end up with long and winding patterns that reach well beyond the convention of a repetitive 16-note loop. Rhythmic Steps\nRhythmic Steps has been particularly aimed towards use with Drum Racks, making it perfect for sequencing polyrhythmic beats. The step sequencer page is especially intuitive for determining note trigger probabilities, while the unique option of an alternate page allows you to cut a different drum sound into a sequencer lane to create distinct variations to your sequence in an instant. There’s also an emphasis on very specific control over swing, plus easily accessible randomisation of settings to encourage drum sequencing that feels dynamic and natural. No Rules\nThere are no rules as to how these sequencers can be used with Live — their intuitive design sits on top of deep potential when you familiarize yourself with all the possible controls. Coupled with the continually expanding synthesis and sound generation potential in the newly updated Live 12.1, the Sequencers by Ableton Pack is a springboard into new territory for any music maker.  Requires Live 12.1 and Max 4 Live!`,

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 02 December 2024 | 134 MB (Win32/64; CLAP,VSTi) SoloRack is a modular synthesizer that mimics the usability and functionality of hardware Eurorack modular systems, without imposing restrictions on the sound. Both analog modeled/emulated or pure digital modules are possible. Even experienced Eurorack users will find something new within almost all modules available while keeping familiarity and similarity to Eurorack intact for ease of use and seamless integration into Eurorack systems.  Main Features include:\n•Practically no limit to the number of modules and rack rows that can be added.\n•The System B currently comes with a variety of modules. Including Oscillator modules, filters, Amplifiers, Mixers, panner, ADSR, VCLFO, Random-Sample and Hold, Noise module, Delay module, •Chorus module, Reverb Module, Ring Modulators, CV sequencer, Trigger sequencer and many more utilities like Input/Ouput modules, MIDI to CV, tempo from DAW, clock divider, logic Tool, switch and CV tools..\n•Can work as an effect with multiple inputs and outputs.\n•Both 14bit and 7bit MIDI is supported concurrently and automatically without preconfiguration!! (currently using LSB/MSB).\n•Polyphony is possible using manual patching as it is done in hardware. Or through the sequencer modules.\n•Multichannel MIDI support. Can be used to achieve multi-timbral voices.\n•MIDI patch points and MIDI cables routing between modules all working at audio rate!!\n•Support for Bi-directional patch points that can work as both inputs or outputs at the same time. As in some Eurorack modules, like switches for example.\n•Offers a ridiculous amount of oversampling (up to X256). This is NOT a zero stuffing or interpolation method. This is an actual increase of the internal sampling rate inside the synth. Which means that it can process ultra sonic audio. I provide such features for people who are particular about quality, Not that any current CPU can handle it!!.\n•Audio rate modulation of any CV input. The system even allows ultra sonic modulation when oversampling.\n•Minimum internal sample block size (1 sample), this gives minimum possible delay between modules.\n•Engineered from ground up to be CPU efficient. With optimization done at each level or development, not just at the end.\n•Connectivity to modular hardware is supported (including but not limited to Eurorack). With 10 Audio/CV inputs, 12 Audio/CV outputs. (Note: For low frequency CV you will need an interface that has •DC coupled inputs/outputs. Or use dedicated modules like the Expert Sleepers(TM) ES-6 and ES-3.\n•Currently 220 presets are available (PLUS extra variations).\n•More modules are expected to be added. Some of them may be included as part of the System B, others will be sold separately.  Changelog:\n– SoloRack v2.21 has been released. This is a minor but important update that mainly adds a few interesting features to the S218 Spectral Filter and fixes some nasty bugs in it.Updates include:\n– Added Extreme Quality mode to S218 Spectral Filter for CPU cooking!!\n– Added VariQ knob to S218 Spectral Filter for both linear phase mode and minimum phase (latency free) mode and for more interesting variable quality effects.\n– Fixed polyphony problems in S218 Spectral Filter\n– Fixed improper saving of edited bars in S218 Spectral Filter\n– A few more fixes and CPU optimization in S218 Spectral Filter`,

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 02 December 2024  | 73 MB The APU Loudness Compressor plug-in is a compressor/expander designed to support modern loudness types (LUFS, True Peak). Typical compressors operate using only RMS and/or Peak units of measurement. But technology has come a long way since then and we’re overdue for an upgrade.. This compressor uses modern industry standard LUFS units of measurement to provide a far more transparent response which is connected to the way humans actually experience loudness. The entire signal flow of the compressor operates within this more precise understanding of loudness. The plug-in user interface provides a more flexible alternative to traditional threshold-and-ratio style of compressor controls. Instead, source and target ranges of loudness can be configured and the compressor will either compress or expand as needed.  With learn mode enabled, the compressor will automatically adjust the source or target range to match the source material. This can be a great way to get started with the compressor and can be used as a starting point for further fine-tuning. Changelog:\nVersion 3.1.0:\n– Dry/wet parameter (limiter)\n– Change AUTO panel layout (limiter)\n– Fix threshold rendering for ceiling < threshold (limiter)\n– Smoother history animation with large buffer sizes\n– Support custom panel and meter textures via theme tab`,

Virta can also be a very useful toolbox for more simple effects. Its processing modules, including an input compressor and a pitch shifter with feedback delay, are very open and transparent at low volumes, coloring the sound more when pushed. Because it’s so easily programmable, drawing on the patcher UI that we’ve obsessively refining for five years, Virta is a quick and gratifying way to dial in that channel effect you want.  Though the audio analyzer is designed to capture the nuances of the human voice, other monophonic instruments will work just fine, producing very musical results. And go ahead and feed a drum loop into it if you like—what comes out will definitely be surprising, and might be just your thing.   LaptopSolution: A witch says, MERRY XMAS!`,

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 24 December 2024 | WiN: 87.4MB | MAC: 96.8MB Sumu breaks completely new ground in software synthesis, combining additive resynthesis with FM and vector field spatialization. Its collection of ten modules, designed around a unique multi-channel patcher, offer musical possibilities not found in any other instrument. In Sumu, sampled sounds are represented as collections of up to 64 bandwidth-enhanced partials, each with a frequency, volume, and noisiness that can change over time. This representation of sound makes all kinds of creative changes possible, from natural-sounding time stretching to exotic timbral manipulations. Using the central multi-channel patcher, each partial in a sound can be manipulated independently in a way that feels more like playing than programming. Pick a few harmonics and frequency-modulate them? No problem. Delay each partial according to its frequency? Sure. Sumu enables precise and careful changes in space and time, or wild chaotic ones. Take a sample, choose a few partials, and place them somewhere else in the sound field. Or explode everything and stir it into a whirlwind of doppler shifted chorus as each partial zooms around on its own path.  And then a stream comes burbling through, and as we listen, the individual droplets are gradually nudged into line to make a quantized rhythm. The pulses module in Sumu is a rich modulator for resynthesis, or a source of complex sounds all on its own. It offers smooth transitions between rhythm and noise, organic and synthetic. As a balance to all of this very modern digital manipulation, there’s an analog-modeled filter based on the classic four-pole Moog ladder design. It can self-oscillate for big vintage sounds, or just round off those prickly edges.  LaptopSolution: A witch says, MERRY XMAS!`,

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 24 December 2024 | WiN: 79.4MB | MAC: 110.3MB Kaivo is a semi-modular software synthesizer that combines two powerful ways of making sound: granular synthesis and physical modeling. Kaivo brings some of the latest academic research in physical modeling to a patchable package for the first time. Mathematically speaking, its finite difference time domain (FDTD) models let the player reach inside the instrument and affect the internal vibrations at any point. This allows for a fine degree of realistic detail, like the bridge rattles on a “gut string” model, for example. And while Kaivo is capable of making very realistic sounds, it is also designed to apply this subtlety to abstract creations.   Like a picture is sometimes worth 1000 words, a physical model is worth 1000 samples. Every time a model is triggered, it makes a slightly different sound due to the initial conditions when the sound starts. This subtle variety can quickly give a very lifelike quality to sounds that would be tedious to recreate with sampling. Kaivo has eight different types of tuned resonators, including strings, chimes and springs, each with its own complex response to sound. As for instrument bodies, there are four, including two wooden body models, a metal plate, and a frame drum—all true 2D models.  Expansive spatial sounds are possible in Kaivo, with independent panning available on grains, resonator, and body. Kaivo’s granulator feeds the models from a 2D map of sound with up to four channels. The body is a true 2D vibrating model of a physical object with left and right pickups that create a spatialized mix of all the frequencies flowing through it. Great for deep environments and filmic spaces. LaptopSolution: A witch says, MERRY XMAS!`,

    description: `Team LaptopSolution | 24 December 2024 | WiN:7.4MB | MAC:12.1MB Aalto is a semi-modular software synthesizer with an innovative, patchable UI, distinctive sounds, and a charming personality. Aalto’s sound engine lets you create sounds that have been difficult or impossible to make with softsynths before now. The heart of Aalto is a Buchla-inspired complex oscillator, with FM, timbre and waveshape controls that enable a wide range of expressive sounds. These sounds are uniquely malleable and alive, in part because they are made with dynamic calculation, not static wavetables. Aalto is designed as much for sequencing patterns as for playing individual notes. Each voice has a separate, built-in sequencer with a patchable, independently controllable rate and offset that make it easy to achieve evolving, chaotic textures.   Each voice also includes a lowpass gate module with a vactrol emulation in the control path. The vactrol equation slows down the response to incoming control signals through a complex nonlinear filter. You can turn the vactrol response down to instantaneous, or up to a pronounced ring. Following the lowpass gate is a patchable waveguide / delay module with a waveshaper and a peaking EQ built into the feedback loop. Because it has such short and controllable delay times, unlike a typical analog delay, it can be used as an additional oscillator or waveguide. Aalto’s filter is a state-variable topology with mixable simultaneous outputs, tuned to have a similar range to an Oberheim SEM filter. (Though I couldn’t resist turning up the resonance just a little more.)  Subjectively speaking, Aalto can make a wide range of sounds, from lush to edgy, including some very complicated ones, without sounding too thick in a mix. Aalto’s sounds are not hyped or confined, they are wide-range, open and natural. We hope our approach will appeal to experienced sound designers who have their own favorite EQs and limiters. And for those just getting into synthesis, Aalto is an accurate and honest tool for learning. We have tried to make Aalto a deep instrument that will reward lasting engagement. Aalto’s manual (included) has over 50 pages full of Aalto lore, tips and tricks, and a complete introduction to patching synthesis! LaptopSolution: A witch says, MERRY XMAS!`,

    description: `FANTASTiC | 24 December 2024 | 0.1 MB What about clip gain, transpose, un/warp and change warp mode directly from the clip in the timeline? Or with shortcuts? Sure! Simply use this device, ClipGain, oh yeah! MaxForLive is your friend, as always.  Let’s Oversampled demonstrate it:\nJust select the clip you want to adjust, press the key/midi you’ve mapped to the device, and a nice little window will pop-up right next to your mouse… that’s the little pop-up window you’re going to love. And it works in both Arrangement and Session view.\n•floating window to control the selected clip’s gain, pitch and warp settings in the Arrangement timeline right under your mouse’s location, without the need to reach for the detailed clip view.\n•shortcuts to quickly add/remove a user-defined amount of dB and semitones to the selected clip.\n•select individual Warp modes with key/midi shortcuts.\n•shortcut to un/warp the selected clip\n•shortcut to crop the selected midi clip in the piano roll (a bit like consolidate, but for midi editor/piano roll) HOW TO: place the device anywhere (I recommend to place it on your Master track and then save as template), key/midi map the single button. That’s it. The device works with the selected clip. Live 9 minimum (it should work with L8, but I didn’t test). v2.2:\n– fixes an Undo issuev2.1:\n– floating window opening optimization\n– Few colors tweaks to ensure compatibility with L12 Themesv2.0:\n– New GUI, thanks to ELPHNT, the one and only.\n– Crop can crop audio clips too (as of L11.3.20)\n– Added clip’s Launch mode, Launch Legato, launch quantization, RAM mode, clip mute,  duplicate midi clip length.\n– Everything has been collected into a single floating window\n– Fixed the Rex/Pro warp mode selection bug\n– Mira support. The device can now be controlled from any smartphone/tablet or even a browser on your computer`,

    description: `Team ViP | 24 December 2024 | 1.27GB Atelier Series Amber is the first of it’s kind – a true, triple-tracked legato vocal library. That means we recorded all of the performances three times (per vowel) and stacked them on top of each other. This way the subtle inconsistencies in speed/pitch between each vocal take can play off each other, resulting in a performance/sound that resides somewhere between a solo vocal and a choir. Initially intended for pop settings, we quickly learned that it’s uniquely-suited for cinematic, EDM and world genres as well. In addition to the natural 3 Ensemble Legato patches, we created faux 9 Ensemble versions; massive lead instruments intended for epic/dramatic passages. With all the legato patches, if you hit velocity 100 or above, it triggers a consonant attack: Lah for the Ah’s, Woh for Oh’s and Doo for Ooo’s. Also included is Awakenings – a keyswitch suite of seven different designed pads sourced from the vocal recordings.  Patches:\n– Amber – 3 Ensemble Legato – Ah\n– Amber – 3 Ensemble Legato – Oh\n– Amber – 3 Ensemble Legato – Ooo\n– Amber – 9 Ensemble Legato – Ah\n– Amber – 9 Ensemble Legato – Oh\n– Amber – 9 Ensemble Legato – Ooo\n– Sustains Ooo – Ah (MW)\n– Sustains Ooo – Oh (MW)\n– Awakenings – KS Features:\n– Triple-stacked legato female vocals\n– 3 Ensemble & faux 9 Ensemble patch variations\n– Looped, non-vibrato performances\n– Consonant attack control\n– Awakenings patch sourced from vocal recordings\n– Adjustable reverb of custom hall impulse   Requires FULL retail version of Kontakt 5.8.1 or higher!`,

    description: `MORiA | 15 July 2024 | 57.9MB .: STANDALONE | AU | VST | VST3 :. Mix faster and more confidently than ever ARC 4 combines an ultra-accurate measurement microphone, analysis software and correction plug-in to improve the accuracy of your monitoring in any room. Work faster and more freely, confident you’re hearing your music itself and that your music will sound great everywhere. With a faster, easier calibration process, breathtaking new more natural algorithm, and the ability to manage profiles on ARC Studio hardware, everything about ARC 4 is designed to let you focus on your music and create audio that translates to any system effortlessly.  Trust what you hear\nA room can have a big impact on how you hear your music. Walls, furniture, and other objects reflect and absorb sound, creating complex artifacts that change the frequency balance and stereo imaging, and can cause your carefully balanced mix to fall apart in other spaces. With ARC, you can detect and account for these issues without expensive room treatment. ARC precisely measures the sound of your room in moments, then generates a correction profile you can load into the ARC plug-in for your DAW or the new ARC Studio hardware, which operates independently from your computer, to ensure what you’re hearing is how your music really sounds. ARC 4 uses a brand-new and more natural analysis and correction algorithm that delivers results you can’t find in other digital room correction systems. By measuring your room across a 3D space around the listening position, IK’s award-winning VRM™ (Volumetric Response Modeling) technology creates a 3D snapshot of your room, identifying problematic issues without over-processing the sound. You have the choice of going through a 21-point ultra-accurate measurement process or a 7-point quicker one. Both will sound great. The longer measurement is more adequate for fixed installations and permanent setups, while the shorter measurement is ideal for on-the-go or ad-hoc setups, making it possible to measure the room in less than a minute. Measure quickly and precisely\nJust connect a measurement mic to your interface and launch the step-by-step room analysis software. You’ll be guided through a series of measurements across your listening position, and with ARC’s flexible placement options you can create measurements of multiple monitors and listening positions, so you can virtually adjust the sweet spot for clients or different setups. More microphone options\nARC 4 includes a precision-manufactured MEMS room analysis microphone for the most precise measurements possible. But you can also use generic measurement microphones, and even load a mic calibration file for superior accuracy. Instantly apply correction\nOnce you’ve generated your profiles, open your DAW and insert ARC 4 across the master bus. ARC applies a precise correction filter using advanced processing to compensate for your room’s acoustics with a higher level of accuracy than ever before. Now you’re hearing your music free of the impact of room acoustics. You can work confident you’re hearing exactly what was recorded, and your work will translate to other rooms and systems better than ever. Deep control to fine-tune your correction\nCustomize your setup for ideal performance no matter your preference. ARC 4 offers deep control over each profile so it always sounds its best: Target curves\nARC 4 comes with 9 factory tailored target curves suitable for most situations. The default curve offers optimally balanced results with Flat and other specific curves for different needs or setups. Adjustable correction range\nBy default, ARC corrects the entire frequency spectrum, but you can define limits to both upper and lower correction ranges separately. This is useful if you want to preserve the unique voicing of your monitors or are just looking to correct a certain frequency range. Variable resolution and smoothing\nAdjust the resolution of the correction filter to use more or fewer frequency bands. Depending on your room’s unique sound, this lets you achieve more surgical correction, or a broader, smoother balance. 2 Phase Modes\nNatural and Linear phase modes ensure precise stereo imaging. Natural mode improves the phase response, while linear phase maintains the original inter-channel phase response, which may be preferable in certain rooms and conditions. Over 20 studio monitor emulations\nARC 4 emulates the frequency and phase response of the most famous studio monitors on the market, working in tandem with the ARC settings for the best possible sound in any listening environment. This is ideal for testing a mix on different reference systems quickly, without ever leaving the sweet spot and ARC’s calibration. You can also use virtual monitoring to intentionally shape your sound to emulate devices like TVs and car audio systems, as well as many popular studio monitors, to quickly listen to your mix on other “virtual” systems to ensure a perfect sound translation. Mix faster and more confidently\n– Dramatically reduce the impact of room acoustics\n– Hear how your music really sounds\n– Stop auditioning mixes on multiple systems\n– Create tracks that sound their best everywhere Faster setup, incredible results\n– New analysis app with simplified measurement process\n– 3D room analysis delivers more accurate, natural sound\n– Improved support for multiple listening setups\n– Works with ARC mic or any RTA (measurement) mic Superior correction, superior control\n– All-new algorithm for incredible sonic transparency\n– 2 phase modes ensure optimum phase coherency\n– Variable resolution for superior results in any room\n– High & low correction ranges put you in control Powerful tools to improve your workflow\n– Virtual monitoring mimics common playback systems\n– With 20+ iconic studio monitor profiles to A/B test mixes\n– PEAK, RMS, LUFS and DR metering at a glance\n– Realtime spectrum analyzer shows pre-corrected signal\n– Re-sizeable, retina display GUI to fit your workflow\n– Manage and switch profiles on ARC Studio hardware Key Features\n– Measurement mic, room analysis software and correction plug-in\n– Improves frequency balance and stereo imaging in any room\n– Work faster and create better mixes without expensive room treatment\n– Virtual monitoring emulates the sound of common listening devices What’s new\n– All-new more natural correction algorithm for incredible results\n– Expanded virtual monitoring adds 20+ iconic studio monitors profiles\n– “Quick Mode” for room processing with just 7 measurement points\n– Updated graphics and user interface with dark and light mode options\n– Ability to manage and switch profiles on ARC Studio hardware Included:\n– Standalone ARC 4 and ARC 4 Analysis\n– AudioUnit ARC 4 VST2 ARC 4 VST3 ARC 4  Included:\n– Standalone ARC 4 and ARC 4 Analysis\n– AudioUnit ARC 4 VST2 ARC 4 VST3 ARC 4`,

    description: `DiSCOVER | 21 MARCH 2015 | 808MB The idea behind NanoMods is a deceptively simple one: take a series of rich, powerful analogue waveforms and pack them into a small, clever sound engine that takes all the effort out of dialling up your own classic patches. The result is a miniature synth module that’s dead easy to use, but which has got it where it counts: in the sound. Each NanoMod aims to fill a specific sonic niche – pads, basses, strings and so on – building into a collection of fresh and focused sounds for your music. As we release more of them, and the collection grows, you can pick and choose the NanoMods you want. They all share similar simple but powerful interfaces, allowing you to dial up your own tones swiftly and efficiently using clever controls that actively help you get the results you want. Each of the synth-style NanoMods starts with two blendable source waveforms sampled from hardware analogue synths, chosen for a specific sonic task (like pad sounds, or string machines).   The aim is to choose two waves that complement each other and sit at either end of the spectrum of sounds the NanoMod is tackling, so that blending between them yields a whole host of intermediate starting-point sounds with the simple twist of a dial. Drum-style NanoMods start with eight non-blendable source waveforms, chosen to represent a wide spread of the type of sound they offer (kicks, snares, cymbals etc). These are entirely original sounds synthesised here in our lab, and feature extra-long decay tails to allow you to tailor the sounds’ decay to your personal preference. This sound-palette is then modified by a carefully-crafted interface which replicates 90% of the functionality of a typical polysynth using only a fraction of the controls… because NanoMod controls are intelligent!`,

    description: `P2P | 21 December 2024 | WiN:555 MB | MAC:431 MB This is an EBX just as much for acoustic pop and singer-songwriter as it’s one for indie rock, new wave or goth. If you’re on the look for an instrument that has thud, thump and earthy vibes at the same time as it’s articulate, focused and piercingly direct enough to stand its own in a dense rock mix, this may be your new go-to. Based on a short-scale and semi-hollow electric bass from 1967, this EBX features a rare and unique-sounding instrument. With its semi-hollow body construction but solid tone, this is a bass that has that best-of-both-worlds quality to it. It’s got a tonal range that encompasses all the electric twang, grit and dirt at the same time as it’s got all the warm, swampy, bluesy and almost acoustic-sounding low end. To add, it was recorded with half-round strings, which even further enhances all of these qualities.

We recorded a “Black Eagle” and cleverly scripted it into a grunge bass library that is mix-ready and fits perfectly into the mix. The real strength of this bass guitar lies in its playability. No machine-gun effect thanks to Multi-Round-Robin. The typical “Grunge-Bass-feeling” can be felt due to the different articulations. The Analog taste gives the bass character and the flavor it needs for a realistic performance of a rocking bass guitar. This is how the bass cuts through your Rock or Grunge mix in a perfectly authentic way.  Here are the main features:\n– NIRWANA BASS for Kontakt\n– clear and easy to use interface\n– Real Multi-Round-Robin and articulations (30 Alternative samples per key/note)\n– Kontakt 5.4.3 and above (48kHz/24bit)\n– dead easy velocity control for a convincing natural-sounding bass performance!\nPlaying hard: note with more “Precision” Attack / playing soft: slide tone\n– clever script: Mod-wheel for SUSTAIN/ black “c” for STOPing sustain with humanized bass noise.\n– Mix-ready (you get what you hear)`,

When used in DAWs, the Tab Player also allows users to export the tablature as an audio file.\n•The Tab Player supports all the fingering, looping, chords, articulations and other markers in the loaded tablature. Supported articulations include: Strum, Natural Harmonic, Artificial Harmonic, •Hammer On/Pull Off, Trill, Bend, Tremolo Bar, Legato Slide, Slide In, Slide Out, Vibrato, Tremolo Picking, Palm Mute, Popping, Tapping, Let Ring, Staccato, Dead Note, Grace Note, Ghost Note, •Accentuated Note, Fade In, etc.\n•As a built-in function, the Tab Player works seamlessly with the Ample Sound instrument engine, which has extremely customized guitar playing logic so as to model a real-world guitar being played. The Tab Player can even judge on its own to automatically add some refining articulations when it thinks it is appropriate, such as slapping on strings or body, or other realistic and indispensable noises.\n•Strumming is an important factor of guitar playing. By taking advantage of the Ample Guitar Strummer engine, the Tab Player can not only mingle different articulations into strumming, but can also alternate between strumming several strings (i.e. multiple notes) simultaneously and strum at a particular string (i.e. one note).`,

Next to the meticulously selected clarinet articulations, we have added those orchestral friends that seemed most appropriate for us – our dream selection. Deep woodwinds and soft brass instruments. This addition enables you to create a broad spectrum of warm organic tones, sometimes quickly sounding like Bernard Herrmann in Hitchcock’s Vertigo. We created a curated set of 15 articulations offering endless options to make the emotive and warm pad sounds we all need and love.  Vertigo Wind\nVertigo Wind is a collection of 15 meticulously selected reeds, brass articulations, and additional sounds that can be mixed freely to fulfil your creative vision intuitively and easily.

Forget hours of automating and scrolling your plugin lists, just plug in Effectrix2 and start drawing. Use the Loopers for looping beyond madness, with easy time, speed and pitch modulation. Go for vintage Scifi with the Ring modulator. Tape Start/Stop and Scratch with the Vinyl effect. Enter alien space ship sounds with the Spectrum effect. Freeze, pitch and stretch with the Grain engine, add notes and chords with the Tonalizer. Crush serves you with the finest digital reduction. The Filter gives you all the dramatic sweeps and fattening. The Phaser adds drama to your queen, while Modulation provides quality Chorus and Flanger effects. Delay and Reverb adding space and the Level effect can be used for trance gates, but also compression and stereo enhancing. The Easy Take\nUnlock Limitless Creative Sound Design\nChoose a sequence length, place some steps in there and the magic is happening. Freeze a snare or roll a hi hat, it is done in a matter of seconds. Have a phaser on the last quarter of your beat and legs start moving already. Alienize vocals, guitars, keyboard lines, induce the obligatory tape stop, turn a simple loop into a breakbeat master piece. You can take things much further with the modulation system, where every parameter can be scripted in no time. Use your keyboard to change effect and modulation sequences. An abundance of presets is always ready to pull the best out of the effects, and the randomizers will take things further and provide endless inspiration. Modulation Mastery\nDetailed Parameters per Effect\nEffectrix2 offers a wide range of modulators which can be applied per step. This results in endless possibilities to create vivid soundscapes. The most straight forward modulator is From To. The modulation will start with your parameter value and then transition to the target value. With the Step Sequencer, you can easily create a modulation per step, turn up the smooth parameter to have a seamless transition. The Envelope Follower directly relates to the power of your audio signal, this allows to create very sound dependent effect variety. The most common use case is the cutoff frequency, reacting to your input amplitude. Then we have classical LFOs to create rhythmic and repeating patterns to perfectly fit to the speed of your project. The Steptrain is a special variant of the Step Sequencer allowing to create stunning stutter effects when connected to the volume parameter. But of course it can be used on any parameter to create interesting results. Precision and Artful Surprises\nPerfect balance of total control and unexpected revelations\nExperience the power of advanced mix blending modes to seamlessly merge and shape your audio elements like never before. With intelligent randomization options woven throughout, serendipity becomes your greatest collaborator. In Effectrix2 you can randomize the whole pattern, a single effect track or the setup of the effect parameters. We implemented 3 intensity levels of randomization, so random results can range from very subtle to total mayhem. Of course we also have a random modulator you can use for parameter control. With tempo and smoothness you have detailed control over how a randomized parameter will behave. Effectrix is known for its stunning looping effects. With Effectrix2 we extended its capabilities. Looper A and B are packed with state-of-the-art features to bring audio looping to a new level.

If you do, expect the upgrade you waited for.   A witch says,\nSugar Bytes plugins have timebomb for users who is really using the plugin. Avoid any unreliable works.

    description: `PHiLOS | 12 January 2025| 905.47 MB Bass Sampled to Destruction Welcome to The Basstard, an instrument focused on recording the gradual destruction of a full-scale orchestral bass. The library contains four core categories of sounds: “Tonal”, “Percussive”, “FX” and “Grooves”. The tonal category covers traditional multi-sampled articulations like plucked, staccato, rubber mallet on strings, regular drumstick on strings, fork on strings, and other tools that could be used for tonal sampling. The percussive category contains a variety of heavy round-robin based articulations, playing the instrument like a drum kit (containing 6-10 round robin articulations). The FX category has a gruesome number of effects such as bowing the bass with a baseball bat, using a power drill on the strings, recording sustained notes from it, and actually power-drilling the bass and reconfigureing the instrument, separating its neck from its body and essentially reassembling the instrument in horrible ways. The Groove category contains unique tempo-synched grooves recorded at several core tempos (80, 90, 100, 110, 120, 130, 140). The result is a deep-sampled instrument that pushes the concept of orchestral bass into a more dark, gritty, percussive and disturbing territory.  Requirements:\n– Full Retail version of Kontakt 5.8.1 or later required\n– Not compatible with the Free Kontakt player\n– The Basstard requires 2GB of hard drive space\n– Minimum: Mac OS X® 10.4 / 10.5, G5 2.0 GHz or Intel Core Duo 2.00 GHz, 4 GB RAM or Windows® XP (32 Bit) or Windows Vista® (32/64 Bit), Pentium® or Athlon XP 2.0 GHz, 4 GB RAM. 4 GB of RAM or more is highly recommended`,

The Estonia Grand contains both Sustains, Staccato and Plucked articulations, which can seamlessly be tailored together based on your compositional needs.

    description: `FANTASTiC | 06 JUNE 2015 | 457 MB MIDI has been around for over 30 years, but do you really understand what it is and how to use it? Let music technology guru explain it all to you, so you can get the most from your Virtual Instruments, Effects, Hardware Boxes and Synths! In this series of 20 movies, Eli will guide you through all the aspects of MIDI that you need to know in order to connect, program and control all of your MIDI-capable software and hardware. Beginning with a general overview of what MIDI is, Eli explores the different types of data contained within MIDI messages. That leads into Note Messages, perhaps the most important MIDI message, and a video on understanding MIDI Note Numbers. Eli then covers the rest of the most common and important MIDI messages such as Aftertouch, Pitch Bend, Program Change, Bank Select, MIDI Continuous Controller, and Channel Mode messages.  Once you’ve learned about the MIDI messages, Eli dives deeper with Multitimbral Mode, explaining how to layer sound across MIDI channels and parts. After that, he covers some of the more esoteric MIDI features such as System Common and System Real Time messages, MIDI Time Code, and System Exclusive messages. Finally, Eli explains the General MIDI convention and Standard MIDI Files, along with the difference between Absolute and Relative Midi Timing. If you have external MIDI devices, you’ll learn how to route MIDI to them, and if you are an OS X user needing to do complex routings, Eli explores the OS X MIDI Setup Utility for even more control and customization. If you’re just getting into computer music and are confused by MIDI, or you’re a longtime musician who really wants to understand it all, check out “MIDI Explained” today!

    description: `P2P | 12 September 2024 | 1.13 GB This great sounding spring reverb is unique among Nebula reverbs, because it includes a control which acts like a ’tilt’ EQ, tilting from ‘bassy’, through flat, to ‘trebly’. It sounds massive on the bassy side. I also provide a fade control which allows you to shorten the length of the reverb while keeping a nice smooth fade-out. These controls are both firsts in the Nebula world, and they allow you to fine-tune the sound so the reverb fits more perfectly in your mixes. I made ‘lite’ versions for use during mixing, that you can use to audition the sound and find the best combinations of settings on the controls that work well in your mix. These versions load fast and use little resources, so you should even be able to use multiple instances. The full versions sound better though, so you should switch to them for rendering, which is quick and easy to do using the buttons on the included custom skin! There’s also a version of the reverb without the fade control, and another without the EQ and fade controls. Those use even less CPU, and all are accessible from the buttons on the skin.   The tape delay program is a bonus, but it can still come in handy on occasion and can sound great. Because of Nebula limitations you can’t fine tune all the relevant settings (such as delay length), but instead you get to select from 20 different delay effects, all in the same program. Each has different delay timings. Some are single tap, others are double or triple, and they all sound different due to the use of different tape speeds and EQ settings during sampling. You can get some great vocal doubling effects. The feedback control is awesome with these also, allowing you to get dub-style mutating echos. Finally, there are also some bonus spring reverbs I made by ‘resampling’ the Nolard spring through an old Orban pseudo stereo processor I have. There are 6 of these ‘fake stereo’ reverbs, made using different setting combos on the Orban, and they actually sound pretty interesting and unique! Includes a skin for both N3 and N4, created by JPN, which allows switching between all of the sampled reverbs by simply pressing buttons! Also, this release is now available in 44.1khz, 48khz, 88.2khz, and 96khz sample rates.`,

    description: `BUBBiX | 04 October 2024 | 32 MB x64:(STANDALONE, VST3, AAX) | x86:(STANDALONE, VST3) The APU Loudness Limiter is a real-time limiter designed to support multiple loudness types simultaneously. The limiter can be configured to use LUFS, True Peak, RMS, and/or Peak loudness types. This allows you to target multiple requirements simultaneously, such as a specific LUFS target and a specific True Peak target. Internally, the ballistics of the limiter are adjusted to accommodate the different loudness type limiter settings.  Loudness flavors\nOne of the key features of this limiter is its support for a variety of loudness types. The limiter’s detection circuitry can be configured to use either LUFS and/or traditional measurement units (RMS, Peak). You can also choose to split or link channels, which is particularly useful for multi-channel audio formats such as Dolby Atmos®. The limiter’s detection circuitry can be configured to use any of the following loudness types:\nMomentary\nMomentary is a short duration LUFS measurement (400ms), which is useful for processing the audio’s moment-by-moment dynamics. This mode is responsive but also transparent. K-weighting and channel weighting are applied to the compressor’s detection circuitry, improving perceptual accuracy. Momentary LUFS Short-Term\nShort-Term is a longer duration LUFS measurement (3 seconds), which is useful for processing the audio’s large scale dynamics. Given the longer duration, this mode is less responsive than momentary, but it can be useful for adjusting the bigger picture of the audio’s dynamics. K-weighting and channel weighting are applied as with momentary. Short-Term LUFS Integrated\nIntegrated is an infinite duration LUFS measurement. K-weighting and channel weighting are applied as with momentary, as well as both relative and absolute gating. This loudness type can be useful for continuously wrangling the audio’s integrated loudness toward a specific target. Integrated LUFS RMS\nRMS loudness types use a rolling time interval of 150ms by default, which can be adjusted. RMS is a traditional loudness measurement, which is a good first-order approximation of perceived loudness. This mode doesn’t apply K-weighting or channel weighting to the limiter’s detection circuitry, giving it a more traditional character. RMS True Peak\nTrue Peak loudness types are similar to traditional peak measurements, but they are more accurate as they take into consideration inter-sample peaks. These measurements use a time interval equal to the configured block size (1ms by default). This mode prevents clipping inter-sample peaks, which can be useful for mastering. True Peak Peak\nPeak loudness types are a standard peak circuit, operating on a time interval equal to the configured block size (1ms by default). This is another traditional limiter style measurement. Technically, this mode is even slightly more responsive than True Peak, but it is less accurate as it doesn’t take into consideration inter-sample peaks. Changelog:\nVersion 3.0.0\n– Initial limiter release (limiter)`,

    description: `TEAM MAGNETRiXX | 12 January 2014 | 336 MB The Music Box is a 19th century automatic musical instrument that produces sounds by the use of a set of pins placed on a revolving cylinder or disc so as to pluck the tuned teeth of a steel comb. They were developed from musical snuff boxes of the 18th century and called carillons à musique. Some of the more complex boxes also have a tiny drum and small bells, in addition to the metal comb. Note that the tone of a musical box is unlike that of any musical instrument (although it is best described as somewhere between the timbres of an mbira).  The Microhammer Music Boxes have been sampled extensively in both dry, room/studio and hall like locations for maximum user flexibility. In addition we have made abstract versions of the patches to get even more content out of these wonderful, childish and haunting devices.

The music box was recorded sitting on an open snare drum, giving more body through the resonance of the drum.\nThe Patch: Full range -The music box is spread across multiple octaves, giving extreme bass and high key options. Low/High Balance – The original 96k samples were pitched down to create a lower octave set of tones for a clear low end option. You can control the balance between low and high tones with the user interface. Mod Wheel for octave blend – Use the mod wheel to select the high, low, or both octaves. Allows for quick changes of timbre. The balance knobs further shape the sound when using both octaves. Pure/Rough Balance – an included convolution impulse response (preloaded in the patch) gives an option for a sharper edge to the tone. Great for darker uses or tension, and easily adjustable from the user interface. For a pure sound, just keep Pure at 100%   INCLUDED: – AGL Music Box.nki (The master Kontakt 4 patch. 48kHz edited samples) – The raw 24bit/96k WAV files (Use with your own sampler or mangle freely!) ***NOTE: the Kontakt patch REQUIRES the full retail version of Kontakt 4 or newer.

Besides the charismatic Wow & Flutter there is chorus, bit crushing, a tape saturation and a versatile vibrato. But also worth to mention is the noise option – certainly an unique and charismatic feature: While playing one of the Electro Pianos, you can add a noise layer to it. Vinyl crackle, hiss, wind, rain and various tape sounds are also available. Finally you can adjust the volume and tone of the noises to suit your electric piano sound. But surley the centerpiece is the 8 different electric pianos. We re-recorded a lot of electric pianos, ran them through our Roland, Dynacord or Revox tape machines or combed through our synthesizer collection, resulting in 8 different charismatic and exciting electric pianos!  To help you understand Magnetic, we’ve created some presets that try to capture the full range of Magnetic. 8 Characterful Key Sounds\n– The Rhodes Mark I:\n+ recorded line\n+ amped\n+ via an Echolette tape delay\n– An Electro Piano Sound of an cheap supermarkt keyboard\n– The Prophet 5 Electro Piano\n– The FM-Synth CZ-101 Electro Piano synth sound\n– An old Electro Piano patch of a Kawai Synth\n– The Hohner Organetta fan organ recorded via an Uher Tape Machine Adding Noise\nImmerse your sound in vintage fog with an additional noise layer, which offers you 11 different noise flavors gathered from tape machines and vinyl turntables.

    description: `HiDERA | 11 January 2025 | 1.3 GB If you’re new to Cubase 14 and are ready to start recording your own music, then this Cubase course is for you. Gary Hiebner guides you through every step of this Cubase video tutorial series, from setting up your audio interface and creating your first project to exporting your final song. Along the way, you’ll learn tons of invaluable skills, from recording audio and MIDI to using buses, effects, and automation; programming drum parts; editing; navigating your session; and much more. These videos are designed for new Cubase 14 users. Gary begins by welcoming you and showing you how to create your first Cubase 14 project, including setting up your audio interface inputs/outputs, adjusting your sample rate and buffer size, and connecting your MIDI devices. Next, you’ll explore the Master Control Strip, where you’ll find some basic, broad-stroke controls for tonal shaping, tuning, and more. Then it’s on to the Model Control Strip, which affords you control over the physical elements of the pianos as well as some synth-style filtering, among other things.  Next, you’ll explore the process of creating tracks, adding rack instruments (MIDI instruments), setting up the project tempo, and recording your first MIDI tracks. You’ll then learn how to quantize (correct timing errors) the recorded MIDI and even see how to quantize automatically while you’re recording if necessary. Then you’ll learn how to edit your parts, which includes trimming, duplicating, adjusting velocities (the loudness of each note played), and more. There’s so much more as well, including the Arranger tools (Range, Scissors, Glue, Mute, etc.), Key Editor (for editing the pitch and length of MIDI notes, etc.), using CC controllers (to edit various MIDI instrument parameters like velocity, modulation, and more), Drum Editor (for editing drum parts), Pattern Sequencer (for creating drum patterns and altering the playback in various ways), different record modes (new part, merge, replace, etc.), importing audio (included content or your own), comping (recording several takes and then compiling one from the best bits of each), using insert and send effects (reverb, delay, etc.), automation (controlling various parameters, such as volume or panning, over time automatically), and more! Using Cubase 14 for the first time can be quite intimidating, and it’s easy to get frustrated. With this course, you’ll get started on the right foot and have a lot of fun learning in the process. By the end of the course, you’ll be absolutely ready to start (and finish!) your first song from start to end. See the individual Cubase 14 video tutorial descriptions for more information on everything that’s covered and how you can get going right away. Begin your Cubase journey today… Watch “Cubase 14 Explained®” today! What You Will Learn:\n– Creating your first project and setting up your hardware (audio interface, MIDI devices).\n– Recording and editing audio and MIDI tracks.\n– Adding effects like reverb, delay, compression, equalization, etc.\n– Exporting your finished song to share with the world.\n– And so much more!`,

    description: `HiDERA | 11 January 2025 | 727 MB Veteran Groove3 instructor Larry Holcombe presents a comprehensive video tutorial series on the Brainworx bx_console N, an incredibly faithful and powerful emulation of the Neve VXS analog console that’s been made even more versatile than the famous hardware version. You’ll learn how to harness the various components for all kinds of tasks—from gating and compression to EQ, filtering, and more. If you’re looking to inject your tracks with some analog-style goodness without sacrificing versatility, this is for you! These videos are designed for new bx_console N users. Larry starts by providing a brief overview, which includes some background information about the emulated Neve hardware console, and then quickly walks you through the interface to help you understand its layout. Then he begins working through the various sections, beginning with the Filter section, where you’ll find the high- and low-pass filters. You’ll then learn how to use the Gate section for not only pedestrian gating but also some creative applications as well, such as side-chain triggering and transient shaping.  The compressor section is up next, and you’ll explore the various parameters for both compression and limiting that allow for parallel compression (via the Mix control), filtering, and more. Larry then explains the EQ section, showing advanced applications like routing the EQ’ed signal back through the compressor to change its response to the input signal. The course wraps up with a look at the Master section, where you’ll find the input levels, meters, etc., followed by a demonstration of the plug-in on some miked drums to inject some life and vibe. This is one of the most versatile and authentic Neve console emulations around, and this bx_console N video course is the quickest and best way to learn how to use it to its fullest potential on your very next production! The individual bx_console N video tutorial descriptions will provide more info about everything that’s covered in the series, as well as give you ideas on how you can make use of it in your own tracks. Classic vibe and punch lies at your fingertips… Watch “bx_console N: Step by Step” today! What You Will Learn:\n– Interface layout and background information on emulated Neve hardware console.\n– Using the Gate section for not only traditional gating but for other tasks as well, such as side-chain applications and shaping transients.\n– Mastering the Compression section, which includes compression and limiting, for dynamic control with a Mix parameter for parallel processing.\n– How to sculpt critical frequency content with the EQ and take advantage of unique routing applications for more versatility.\n– And more!`,
